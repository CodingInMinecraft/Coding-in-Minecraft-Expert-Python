# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 6 Activity 1
### @explicitHints true
  

## Step 1 
  
We are going to start practicing combining everything you have learned.  In this activity, the player must break 6 oak plank blocks.  When that is complete, the agent will build a 6x6 square made of oak plank blocks.  

First, begin by creating a variable named block2 with the value of 0.  
Then, create a on blocks broken code for oak planks.  When a block is broken, have the variable blocks increase by 1. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
block2 = 0

def on_block_broken_planks_oak():
    global block2
    block2 += 1
blocks.on_block_broken(PLANKS_OAK, on_block_broken_planks_oak)

```

## Step 2

Next, create and if / else statement.  In the if section check to see if the variable block2 is greater than 5. 
If it is true, have the agent set item code give the agent 64 oak planks in slot 1, the agent set assist code have place on move set to true, and the agent set assist code have destroy obstacles to true.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
block2 = 0

def on_block_broken_planks_oak():
    global block2
    block2 += 1
    if block2 > 5:
        agent.set_item(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
        agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
    else:
        pass
blocks.on_block_broken(PLANKS_OAK, on_block_broken_planks_oak)

```

## Step 3
Still inside the if section, we want to have the agent build the square.  Create a for loop.


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
block2 = 0

def on_block_broken_planks_oak():
    global block2
    block2 += 1
    if block2 > 5:
        agent.set_item(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
        agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
        for index in range(4):
            pass
    else:
        pass
blocks.on_block_broken(PLANKS_OAK, on_block_broken_planks_oak)

```

## Step 4
Next, inside the loop have the agent move forward by 5 and then turn left. 
Then close the loop.  After that add the code that makes the agent move up by 1.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
block2 = 0

def on_block_broken_planks_oak():
    global block2
    block2 += 1
    if block2 > 5:
        agent.set_item(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
        agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
        for index in range(4):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    else:
        pass
blocks.on_block_broken(PLANKS_OAK, on_block_broken_planks_oak)

```

## Step 5
Lastly, in the else section, have the player say "Keep breaking!"
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
block2 = 0

def on_block_broken_planks_oak():
    global block2
    block2 += 1
    if block2 > 5:
        agent.set_item(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
        agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
        for index in range(4):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    else:
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
blocks.on_block_broken(PLANKS_OAK, on_block_broken_planks_oak)

```

2. Go break 6 oak plank blocks.
3. You will know your code is correct when the player will say "Keep Breaking 5 times.

4. After the 6th time breaking the block, the agent will build the square.

## Step 8

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
