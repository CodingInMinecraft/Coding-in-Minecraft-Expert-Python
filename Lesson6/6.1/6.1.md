# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6 Activity 1
### @explicitHints true
  

## Step 1 
  
We are going to start practicing combining everything you have learned.  In this activity, the player must break 6 oak plank blocks.  When that is complete, the agent will build a 6x6 square made of oak plank blocks.  

First, begin by creating a variable named block2 with the value of 0.  
Then, create a on blocks broken code for oak planks.  When a block is broken, have the variable blocks increase by 1. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let block2 = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    
})
```

## Step 2

Next, create and if / else statement.  In the if section check to see if the variable block2 is greater than 5. 
If it is true, have the agent set item code give the agent 64 oak planks in slot 1, the agent set assist code have place on move set to true, and the agent set assist code have destroy obstacles to true.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let block2 = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        
    } else {
        
    }
})
```

## Step 3
Still inside the if section, we want to have the agent build the square.  Create a for loop.  In the first condition, create a variable of index with a value of 0.  The second condition will have the index less than 4.  Then the third condition will have the index increase by 1 after each iteration. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let block2 = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
  
        }
       
    } else {
        
    }
})
```

## Step 4
Next, inside the loop have the agent move forward by 5 and then turn left. 
Then close the loop.  After that add the code that makes the agent move up by 1.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let block2 = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    } else {
        
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Lastly, in the else section, have the player say "Keep breaking!"
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let block2 = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    } else {
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
    }
})
```

## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

2. Go break 6 oak plank blocks.
3. You will know your code is correct when the player will say "Keep Breaking 5 times.

4. After the 6th time breaking the block, the agent will build the square.

## Step 8

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
