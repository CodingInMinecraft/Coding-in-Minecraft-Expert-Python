# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 6 Activity 4
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

You are going to write a code that has the agent destroy all the blocks in this grid.  When they destroy them, they will also count the blocks by type and the player will say each block destroyed and how many of that type they have.  

Begin by declaring 6 variables with the following names:
width, length, gold, emerald, diamond, 
lapis

All variables should be assigned the value of 0 EXCEPT width should be assigned the value of 14. 

### ~ tutorialhint

```python


width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

```




## Step 2
Next, create an on chat command named destroy.  Inside the on chat command, create a while loop that checks if the width is greater than 0.  All other code will be nested in this while loop. 
Inside that while loop, create another while loop that checks if the length is less than or equal to 13. 

### ~ tutorialhint

```python

width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

def on_on_chat():
    while width > 0:
        while length <= 13:
            pass
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)


```

## Step 3
Inside the second while loop, create an if / elif / else statement (with 3 elif sections).  In the If section, check that if the agent inspects a block forward and it is equal to a gold block do the following:
Have the agent destroy forward
Increase the gold variable by 1
Have the player say "the variable gold gold blocks!" (He will be saying how many gold blocks have been destroy so far.)
Have the agent move forward by 1. 
Increase the variable length by 1. 
### ~ tutorialhint

```python


width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

def on_on_chat():
    global gold, length
    while width > 0:
        while length <= 13:
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                gold += 1
                player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif :
                pass
            elif :
                pass
            elif :
                pass
            else:
                pass
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)

```



## Step 4

In the first elif section, have the agent inspect the block forward and if it is an emerald block do the following:
Have the agent destroy forward
Increase the emerald variable by 1
Have the player say "the variable emerald emerald blocks!" (He will be saying how many emerald blocks have been destroy so far.)
Have the agent move forward by 1. 
Increase the variable length by 1. 

### ~ tutorialhint

```python

width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

def on_on_chat():
    global gold, length, emerald
    while width > 0:
        while length <= 13:
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                gold += 1
                player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == EMERALD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                emerald += 1
                player.say("" + str(emerald) + " Emerald blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif :
                pass
            elif :
                pass
            else:
                pass
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)


```
## Step 5
In the second elif section, have the agent inspect the block forward and if it is an diamond block do the following:
Have the agent destroy forward
Increase the diamond variable by 1
Have the player say "the variable diamond diamond blocks!" (He will be saying how many diamond blocks have been destroy so far.)
Have the agent move forward by 1. 
Increase the variable length by 1.

### ~ tutorialhint

```python


width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

def on_on_chat():
    global gold, length, emerald, diamond
    while width > 0:
        while length <= 13:
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                gold += 1
                player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == EMERALD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                emerald += 1
                player.say("" + str(emerald) + " Emerald blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                diamond += 1
                player.say("" + str(diamond) + " diamond blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)

```


## Step 6

In the third elif section, have the agent inspect the block forward and if it is an lapis luzuli block do the following:
Have the agent destroy forward
Increase the lapis variable by 1
Have the player say "the variable lapis lapis blocks!" (He will be saying how many lapis blocks have been destroy so far.)
Have the agent move forward by 1. 
Increase the variable length by 1.

### ~ tutorialhint

```python


width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

def on_on_chat():
    global gold, length, emerald, diamond, lapis
    while width > 0:
        while length <= 13:
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                gold += 1
                player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == EMERALD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                emerald += 1
                player.say("" + str(emerald) + " Emerald blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                diamond += 1
                player.say("" + str(diamond) + " diamond blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == LAPIS_LAZULI_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                lapis += 1
                player.say("" + str(lapis) + " lapis blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            else:
                pass
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)

```


## Step 7
Then, in the else section, have the player say "No blocks!" Have the agent move forward by 1 and increase the variable length by 1. Then close the if statement. Also close the inner while loop. 
After that, while still in the outer while loop do the following: 
 have the variable width decrease by 1
 have the agent turn left
 have the agent move forward by 1 
 have the agent turn left
 set the variable length to 0


### ~ tutorialhint

```python


width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

def on_on_chat():
    global gold, length, emerald, diamond, lapis, width
    while width > 0:
        while length <= 13:
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                gold += 1
                player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == EMERALD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                emerald += 1
                player.say("" + str(emerald) + " Emerald blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                diamond += 1
                player.say("" + str(diamond) + " diamond blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == LAPIS_LAZULI_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                lapis += 1
                player.say("" + str(lapis) + " lapis blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            else:
                player.say("No Block!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
        width += -1
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        length = 0
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)


```

## Step 8
 Next, we want the agent to do the same thing it did in the previous row, so you need to duplicate the entire inner while loop and put it after the last agent turn left code. 


### ~ tutorialhint

```python


width = 14
length = 0
gold = 0
emerald = 0
diamond = 0
lapis = 0

def on_on_chat():
    global gold, length, emerald, diamond, lapis, width
    while width > 0:
        while length <= 13:
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                gold += 1
                player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == EMERALD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                emerald += 1
                player.say("" + str(emerald) + " Emerald blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                diamond += 1
                player.say("" + str(diamond) + " diamond blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == LAPIS_LAZULI_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                lapis += 1
                player.say("" + str(lapis) + " lapis blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            else:
                player.say("No Block!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
        width += -1
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        length = 0
        while length <= 13:
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                gold += 1
                player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == EMERALD_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                emerald += 1
                player.say("" + str(emerald) + " Emerald blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                diamond += 1
                player.say("" + str(diamond) + " diamond blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == LAPIS_LAZULI_BLOCK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                lapis += 1
                player.say("" + str(lapis) + " lapis blocks!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
            else:
                player.say("No Block!")
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                length += 1
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)

```



## Step 9
After the second inner while loop do the following: 
 have the variable width decrease by 1
 have the agent turn right
 have the agent move forward by 1 
 have the agent turn right
 set the variable length to 0

Then close the outer while loop.

        width += -1
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        length = 0
    while length <= 13:
        if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK:
            agent.destroy(FORWARD)
            gold += 1
            player.say("" + str(gold) + " Gold blocks!")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            length += 1
        elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == EMERALD_BLOCK:
            agent.destroy(FORWARD)
            emerald += 1
            player.say("" + str(emerald) + " Emerald blocks!")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            length += 1
        elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_BLOCK:
            agent.destroy(FORWARD)
            diamond += 1
            player.say("" + str(diamond) + " diamond blocks!")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            length += 1
        elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == LAPIS_LAZULI_BLOCK:
            agent.destroy(FORWARD)
            lapis += 1
            player.say("" + str(lapis) + " lapis blocks!")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            length += 1
        else:
            player.say("No Block!")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            length += 1
player.on_chat("destroy", on_on_chat)



```

## Step 10
Lastly, because the width is actually 15 blocks long, we want to have the agent go down 1 more row. To do that, copy the inner while loop and paste it OUTSIDE of the outer while loop.  Then close the chat command. 


### ~ tutorialhint

```python
width = 14
