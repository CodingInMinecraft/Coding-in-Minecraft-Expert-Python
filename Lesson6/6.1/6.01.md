## Step 1 @unplugged

When you create something on a computer, like a document, image, or video, it becomes your intellectual property or belongs to the organization you work for. However, with the ease of accessing and sharing digital information, there are concerns about who owns it, how valuable it is, and how it can be used. It's important to take steps to protect intellectual property.


## Step 2 @unplugged
Using someone else's material without permission and presenting it as your own is called plagiarism, and it can have legal consequences. However, there are legal ways to use materials created by others. For example, Creative Commons is a public copyright license that allows creators to share their work and let others use and build upon it. Open-source programs are freely available and can be redistributed and modified. Open access refers to research output that is freely accessible and has fewer restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions. Whenever you use someone else's work, it's essential to cite the source.

## Step 3 @unplugged
Creative Commons, open source, and open access have made it easier for people to access digital information. However, just like any other technology or medium, the use of computing to harm individuals or groups raises legal and ethical concerns. Computing can also be involved in social and political issues, which often bring up legal and ethical considerations.

## Step 4 @unplugged
Computing innovations can raise legal and ethical concerns in various ways. For example, the development of software that enables illegal downloading or streaming of digital media raises legal issues. Algorithms that incorporate bias can lead to unfair outcomes and ethical concerns. The existence of computing devices that continuously monitor and analyze our activities raises privacy and ethical concerns.

## Step 5 @unplugged
In conclusion, it's important to respect intellectual property rights, be aware of legal and ethical considerations when using computing technology, and understand the implications of innovations that raise concerns about privacy, bias, and access to digital information.
