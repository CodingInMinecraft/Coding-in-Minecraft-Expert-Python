# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6 Activity 5
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

Let's continue practicing putting everything you have learned together by having the agent build a 10 x 10 checker board on the ground.  While building the player will say what color block is being placed and what row the agent has finished. 
Start by declaring a variable named row with the value of 0. 

Then create a on chat command with the name of checkers. 

Inside the on chat command do the following:
Use the set Item code to give the agent 50 quartz slabs in slot 1. 
Use the set Item code to give the agent 50 nether brick slabs in slot 2. 
Have the agent move forward by 1. 


### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let row = 0
player.onChat("checkers", function () {
    agent.setItem(QUARTZ_SLAB, 50, 1)
    agent.setItem(NETHER_BRICK_SLAB, 50, 2)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    
})
```

## Step 2

Next create a for loop that have the variable i and checks for i to be less than or equal to 9 and has i increase by 1 with each iteration. 
Inside that for loop, create another for loop with the variable index that checks for index to be less than 5 and increases by 1 with each iteration. 


### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let row = 0
player.onChat("checkers", function () {
    agent.setItem(QUARTZ_SLAB, 50, 1)
    agent.setItem(NETHER_BRICK_SLAB, 50, 2)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            
        }
        
    }
})
```


## Step 3

Next, in the inner for loop, do the following:
Have the agent move forward by 1
Have the agent set the active slot to 1
Have the agent place back. 
Have the player say "Agent placed a white block."

### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let row = 0
player.onChat("checkers", function () {
    agent.setItem(QUARTZ_SLAB, 50, 1)
    agent.setItem(NETHER_BRICK_SLAB, 50, 2)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(1)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a white block")
            
        }
        
    }
})
```


## Step 4
Continuing inside the inner for loop, after the player say code, do the following:
Have the agent move forward by 1
Have the agent set the active slot to 2
Have the agent place back.
Have the player say "Agent placed a black block"

Then close the inner for loop. 

### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let row = 0
player.onChat("checkers", function () {
    agent.setItem(QUARTZ_SLAB, 50, 1)
    agent.setItem(NETHER_BRICK_SLAB, 50, 2)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(1)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a white block")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(2)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a black block")
        }
        
    }
})
```



## Step 5
Next, after the inner for loop, create an if / else statement that checks if the modulus of i is equal to 0, have the agent turn left. Else have the agent turn right. 

### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let row = 0
player.onChat("checkers", function () {
    agent.setItem(QUARTZ_SLAB, 50, 1)
    agent.setItem(NETHER_BRICK_SLAB, 50, 2)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(1)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a white block")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(2)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a black block")
        }
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        } else {
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        }
        
    }
})
```

## Step 6
After the if /else statement, have the agent move forward by 1 and then do another if statement exactly like the first one (you can just duplicate the code to make it more efficient). Then have the agent move forward by 1 again. 

### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let row = 0
player.onChat("checkers", function () {
    agent.setItem(QUARTZ_SLAB, 50, 1)
    agent.setItem(NETHER_BRICK_SLAB, 50, 2)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(1)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a white block")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(2)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a black block")
        }
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        } else {
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        } else {
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        
    }
})
```

## Step 7
Lastly, have the variable row increase by 1 and then have the player say "The agent finished row 'the variable row.'"

### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let row = 0
player.onChat("checkers", function () {
    agent.setItem(QUARTZ_SLAB, 50, 1)
    agent.setItem(NETHER_BRICK_SLAB, 50, 2)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(1)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a white block")
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.setSlot(2)
            agent.place(BACK)
            player.say("Agent placed a black block")
        }
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        } else {
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        } else {
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        row += 1
        player.say("The agent finished row " + row)
    }
})
```
