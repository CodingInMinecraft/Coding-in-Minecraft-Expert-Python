# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6 Activity 2
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 

In this activity, you will build a code that builds off the last code you built.  This time, we want the agent to build a 6 x 6 X 4 hollow cube.  We also want the player to say what is happening while the code is being built. 
The first step would be to create a new variable called level and assign it the value of 0. 

```template
let block2 = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    } else {
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
    }
})
```

```javascript

let block2 = 0
let level = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    } else {
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
    }
})
```


## Step 2
Now, add a while loop around the for loop. (You will be nesting the for loop inside the while loop.)  Have the while loop run while the variable level is less than or equal to 3. 

Also, we want to make sure the agent has enough blocks, so add another set Item code inside the while loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

let block2 = 0
let level = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        while (level <= 3) {
            agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
            for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
                agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
                agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
            }
            agent.move(UP, 1)
            
        }
    } else {
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
    }
})
```




## Step 3
Now, after the agent move up code, add a code that increases the variable level by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

let block2 = 0
let level = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        while (level <= 3) {
            agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
            for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
                agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
                agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
            }
            agent.move(UP, 1)
            level += 1
            
        }
    } else {
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
    }
})
```

## Step 4
Now we need to make the code that has the player say when the agent has built each level. Create an if /else if statement after the increase level code. (You will need 3 else if sections.)  Have the if statement check to see if level is equal to 1.  If it is, the player will say "The agent has built the first level."

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

let block2 = 0
let level = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        while (level <= 3) {
            agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
            for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
                agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
                agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
            }
            agent.move(UP, 1)
            level += 1
             if (level == 1) {
                player.say("The agent has built the first level.")
            } else if () {
                
            } else if () {
                
            } else if () {
                
            }
        }
    } else {
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Lastly, you will need to fill in the else if sections, almost exactly like the one you did in the if section.  However, the second one will check to see if level is equal to 2 and the player will say "The agent has built the second level."  Can you figure out what the third and fourth else if sections will say?  Build the rest of the code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

let block2 = 0
let level = 0
blocks.onBlockBroken(PLANKS_OAK, function () {
    block2 += 1
    if (block2 > 5) {
        agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
        agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
        while (level <= 3) {
            agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
            for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
                agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
                agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
            }
            agent.move(UP, 1)
            level += 1
             if (level == 1) {
                player.say("The agent has built the first level.")
            } else if (level == 2) {
                player.say("The agent has built the second level.")
            } else if (level == 3) {
                player.say("The agent has built the third level.")
            } else if (level == 4) {
                player.say("The agent has built the fourth level.")
            }
        }
    } else {
        player.say("Keep Breaking!")
    }
})
```

## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 7 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Reset the activity zone area. 
3. Go break 6 oak plank blocks.
4. You will know your code is correct when the player will say "Keep Breaking 5 times and then after the 6th time breaking the block, the agent will build the cube.  After each level built, the player will say what level the agent just built.

## Step 8

When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
