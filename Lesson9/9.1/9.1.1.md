# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 9 Activity 2
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

In the last activity, you learned about sequencing, one way to create an algorithm.  Another way to create an algorithm is through **iteration,** which is **when you do some steps over and over again.**

```template
player.onChat("floor", function () {
    agent.setItem(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    gent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```

## Step 2

You learned about iteration when you learned about **loops**.  Below is the code you created for sequencing.   Change it to include iteration by deleting some of the steps and placing others in a loop. Begin by creating a for loop that runs 4 times after the agent set Item code.  Inside the loop have the agent destroy down, place, down, and move forward by 1. Delete any unnecessary code. 




#### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    for index in range(4):
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```


## Step 3
Next, create a for loop after the first one that runs 2 times.  Inside the loop have the agent turn left and move forward by 1. 
Then delete any unnecessary code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    for index in range(4):
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for index2 in range(2):
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 4
Now create another for repeat loop that runs four times exactly like the first for loop.  Delete any unnecessary code. 


### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    for index in range(4):
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for index2 in range(2):
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for index3 in range(4):
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 5
Next, create a for loop that runs 2 times. Inside the loop have the agent turn right and then move forward by 1. Delete any unnecessary code. 


### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    for index in range(4):
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for index2 in range(2):
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for index3 in range(4):
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for index4 in range(2):
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```


## Step 6
Lastly, put a for loop around all of the code after the agent set item code that runs 2 times.  

### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    for index in range(2):
        for index2 in range(4):
            agent.destroy(DOWN)
            agent.place(DOWN)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        for index3 in range(2):
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        for index4 in range(4):
            agent.destroy(DOWN)
            agent.place(DOWN)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        for index5 in range(2):
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)

```


## Step 7

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat by pressing T. 
3. Type floor and hit enter. 
4. You know your code is correct when the agent builds a 4x4 floor.

## Step 9

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
