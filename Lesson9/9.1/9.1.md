## Step 1 @unplugged

An **algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer program follows to accomplish a task or solve a problem.** Whenever you write code, you are writing an algorithm. 
The order of the algorithm will determine the outcome. **Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results.** For example, the two algorithms below have the same steps but in different orders.  What do you think will happen in each algorithm.?

**Algorithm 1:**

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    for index in range(4):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(UP, 1)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

**Algorithm 2:**

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.move(UP, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    for index in range(4):
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)



## Step 2 @unplugged

You would have been correct if you said Algorithm 1 will have the agent build a 5x5 square. Algorithm 2 will have the agent build a 5x5 square missing one block, one block in the air. 

While the steps of an algorithm determine the outcome, **algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks**. 

For example, both algorithms below will do the same thing (make a 5x5 square), even though they are written differently. 

**Algorithm 1:**

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    for index in range(4):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(UP, 1)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

**Algorithm 2:**

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(UP, 1)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)



## Step 3

Algorithms are created in different ways. One way is by **sequencing**, which is **putting steps in order**.  


![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson9/9.1/9.1.JPG?raw=true  "Sequencing")

Let's write a code that uses an algorithm that is developed by sequencing. In this code we are going to make a 4x4 stone floor. 

First, create an on chat command called floor. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
def on_on_chat():
    pass
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 4

Next, add the code in the chat command that has the agent set the item of stone at the count of 64 in the slot of 1 in his inventory.  Then have the agent destroy down, place down, and then move forward by 1. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("wall", on_on_chat)


```

## Step 5
Because we are building this code with sequencing, we need to write the code in order. This means that the agent needs to repeat the steps of destroy down, place down, and move forward by 1 another 3 times. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 6
Now, have the agent turn left, move forward by 1, turn left, and then move forward by 1. This will put the agent on the next row.  Then have the agent destroy down, place down, and move forward 4 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 7
Next, have the agent turn right, move forward by 1, turn right, and then move forward by 1. This will put the agent on the third row.  Then have the agent destroy down, place down, and move forward 4 times. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```
## Step 8
Lastly, have the agent turn left, move forward by 1, turn left, and then move forward by 1. This will put the agent on the last row.  Then have the agent destroy down, place down, and move forward 4 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("floor", on_on_chat)
```
