Let's continue learning about program function. 
**A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer.** 
A program is essentially a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what tasks to perform. These tasks can range from simple calculations to complex operations. When a program is executed (run) by a computer, it follows the sequence of instructions provided and performs the specified task. The term "**software"** is commonly used interchangeably with "program" to **refer to any set of instructions that can be run on a computer to accomplish a task.**

## Step 2 @unplugged

**A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.**
A code segment is a group of program statements that are grouped together to perform a specific subtask within the larger program. It's a way of organizing code to improve readability, maintainability, and reusability. In complex programs, **breaking down the functionality into smaller, manageable code segments makes the overall program structure more modular and easier to work with.**
