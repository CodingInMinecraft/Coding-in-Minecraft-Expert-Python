## Step 1 @unplugged

There are certain problems that computers are unable to solve, and even when they can solve a problem, it might take them an unreasonable amount of time to do so. 
**A problem is a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved algorithmically.** An instance of a problem also includes specific input. For example, sorting is a problem; sorting the list (2,3,1,7) is an instance of the problem. 

## Step 2 @unplugged

There are two main types of problems: decision problems and optimization problems. **A decision problem is one that can be answered with a simple yes or no** (e.g., determining if there is a path from point A to point B). 
On the other hand, an **optimization problem involves finding the "best" solution among many possibilities** (e.g., identifying the shortest path from point A to point B).

## Step 3 @unplugged

**Algorithmic efficiency refers to how well an algorithm performs in terms of time and resources required to solve a problem.** It measures how quickly an algorithm can find a solution and how much space or memory it needs to do so.

Imagine you have a task to complete, such as sorting a list of numbers. There are different ways to solve this task, and each way is like a different algorithm. Now, algorithmic efficiency is like comparing how fast and efficient these different algorithms are at sorting the list.

## Step 4 @unplugged

When we talk about algorithmic efficiency, we usually consider two main factors: time complexity and space complexity.

**Time complexity is about how much time it takes for an algorithm to run**. It measures how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. For example, if we have a list with 10 numbers, how long does the algorithm take to sort it? If we have a list with 100 numbers, does the algorithm take longer? **Algorithms with better time complexity are faster and more efficient.**

**Space complexity refers to how much memory or space an algorithm needs to solve a problem.** It measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases. **Efficient algorithms use minimal space or memory,** which is important when dealing with large amounts of data.

## Step 5 @unplugged

To understand algorithmic efficiency, think of it like choosing the best way to solve a problem. **You want to find an algorithm that can solve the problem quickly and with minimal resources.** It's like finding the fastest route to school or the most efficient way to complete a task, but in the context of algorithms and computer science.

**By analyzing and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms, we can choose the most suitable one for a given problem.** This helps us optimize the performance of our programs, saving time and resources in the process.
