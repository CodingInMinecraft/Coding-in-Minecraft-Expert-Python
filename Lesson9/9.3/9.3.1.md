## Step 1

**An algorithm’s efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes**.

Let's try this out in the game.  
First, create a variable called currentNumber and assign it the value of 0. Then create an array of numbers 1,2,3,4,5.  (You will learn more about arrays in the next lesson.  For now, the code is below.)

    let numbers =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let currentNumber =  0
let numbers =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Step 2

Next, create a for loop.  In the for loop, initialize a variable `i` with the value `0`.  Then, check whether the value of `i` is less than or equal to the length of the `numbers` array minus 1.
And add 1 to the value of `i` after each iteration of the loop.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let currentNumber =  0
let numbers =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for  (let i =  0; i <= numbers.length -  1; i++)  {

}
```

## Step 3
Inside the loop assign currentNumber the value of numbers[i] and have the player say the current number. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let currentNumber =  0
let numbers =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for  (let i =  0; i <= numbers.length -  1; i++)  {
	currentNumber = numbers[i]
	player.say(currentNumber)
}
```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

2. You will know your code is correct when your player says 5 things 1, 2, 3, 4, and then 5.

## Step 6 @unplugged

We can now see that the algorithmic efficiency was 5. 
**By counting the number of times a statement or group of statements executes, we can get an idea of how the algorithm's efficiency scales with the input size.** In this case, the efficiency is directly related to the number of elements in the list.
