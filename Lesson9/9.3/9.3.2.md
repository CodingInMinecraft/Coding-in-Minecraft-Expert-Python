## Step 1 @unplugged
There are other ways to measure algorithmic efficiency. 

 Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies. 
  **Polynomial efficiency is a way to measure how well an algorithm performs in terms of time as the size of the problem increases**. It tells us how the running time of an algorithm grows with the input size.

Imagine you have a problem to solve, like sorting a list of numbers. There are different algorithms to solve this problem, and we want to know how fast they are. Polynomial efficiency helps us understand that.

When we talk about polynomial efficiency, we look at the time complexity of an algorithm. **Time complexity tells us how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases**. We use mathematical expressions called polynomials to describe this growth.

## Step 2 @unplugged

Algorithms with **exponential or factorial efficiencies** are examples of algorithms that run in an **unreasonable amount of time.**

   Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them. In these cases, approximate solutions are sought. 
   
   A **heuristic** is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that is **not guaranteed to be optimal but may be used when techniques that are guaranteed to always find an optimal solution are impractical.**
