## Step 1 @unplugged

Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms. Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm 
has benefits such as reducing development time, reducing testing, and simplifying the identification of errors.

## Step 2

We are going to practice this by first reviewing an algorithm that builds a 5x5 square.  
Run the code below to see how it works.  

```template
    player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	    agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	    for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
		    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		}
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	})
	
```
## Step 3

Now that you understand how that algorithm works, let's use that knowledge to create a new algorithm that builds a pyramid with 3 levels, the middle level, being a 5 x 5 square.  

We know the code to build a 5x5 square and already have it below.  We will now need to use it and our knowledge of how it works to build a pyramid. If the middle layer is 5x5, we want the bottom layer to be 2 blocks larger. Change the agent move forward from 4 to 6.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
})
```

## Step 4

Now, we want the agent to move forward before building the next square so we need to set the place on move to false and have the agent move forward by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
})
```


## Step 5

Next, you can repeat the steps to build the square but for a 5x5 instead of 7x7, starting with setting the place on move to true. Then add the set assist to false and agent move forward by 1 after you build the 5x5 square. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
})
```


## Step 6

Next, you want to repeat the steps to move the agent forward without placing down a block and then the steps to have the agent build a 3x3 square.  


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  2)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	
})
```

## Step 7

The last step is to have the agent place 1 block to top the pyramid.  Add the code to have the agent place forward to do this. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  2)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.place(FORWARD)
})
```

## Step 9
When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
