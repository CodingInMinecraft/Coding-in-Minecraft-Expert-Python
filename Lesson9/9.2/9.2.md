## Step 1

When writing algorithms, you may use conditionals or booleans, and sometimes both.  However, some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions and some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements.
Let's explore this by first building a code that uses a conditional statement. 

First, declare 2 variables. One named score with the value of 0 and the other named endGame the value of an empty string (" ").  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""

```

## Step 2

Next, create a code that when a grass blocks is placed, the variable score increases by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})

```

## Step 3

Now, create an on chat command named scoreCheck.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
)
})

```

## Step 4

Inside the On Chat command, add an if / else statement that checks the condition if the variable score is greater than 5. If it is true, the player will say true.  If it is false, the player will say false. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
	if  (score >  5)  {
		endGame =  "True!"
	}  else  {
		endGame =  "False"
	}
	player.say(endGame)
})

```

## Step 5

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Place down some grass blocks. (You can find the grass blocks in the chest near the activity zone.)
3. Open the chat by pressing T and enter scoreCheck.  
4. You will know your code is correct if your players says True if you placed more than 5 blocks down or False if you placed 5 or less.

## Step 7
When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
