# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 9 Activity 5
### @explicitHints true


## Step 1

Let's continue practicing using code that uses conditional statements and booleans.  

First, declare 1 variable named blocksPlaced and assign it the value of 0. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let blocksPlaced = 0

```

## Step 2
Next, create a chat command named place down.  Inside the chat command, write an if / else statement that checks if blocksPlaced is equal to 5. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let blocksPlaced = 0
player.onChat("placeDown", function () {
   
        if (blocksPlaced == 5) {
            
        } else {
            
        }
    
})
```


## Step 3
Inside the conditional, if blocksPlaced is equal to 5, have the player say stop.  In the else section, give the agent 64 Oak Planks in slot 1. Then set place on move to true and have the agent move forward by 1.  Then increase blocksPlaced by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let blocksPlaced = 0
player.onChat("placeDown", function () {
    
        if (blocksPlaced == 5) {
            player.say("Stop")
        } else {
            agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            blocksPlaced += 1
        }
    
})
```
## Step 4
Lastly, add a for loop around the if/else statement that runs 6 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let blocksPlaced = 0
player.onChat("placeDown", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 6; index++) {
        if (blocksPlaced == 5) {
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
            player.say("Stop")
        } else {
            agent.setItem(PLANKS_OAK, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            blocksPlaced += 1
        }
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat by pressing T and enter placeDown.   
3. You will know your code is correct when the agent will walk forward and place down 5 blocks. Then the player will say stop.

## Step 8
When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
