## Step 1

We are going to continue writing comments for our code.  The code below uses functions to plant a garden.  Run the code to see how it works. 

First, write a single line comment for the function sunflower, cornflower, and tulip. Put the command above the function it is documenting. 

```template
function sunflower()  {
	agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}

function cornflower ()  {
	agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}

function tulip ()  {
	agent.setItem(RED_TULIP,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}

function garden(flowers:  number)  {
	sunflower()
	cornflower()
	tulip()
}
player.onChat("plant",  function  ()  {
	garden(1)
})
```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
//The function sunflower gives the agent 1 sunflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function sunflower()  {
	agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function cornflower gives the agent 1 cornflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function cornflower ()  {
	agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function tulip gives the agent 1 tulip in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function tulip ()  {
	agent.setItem(RED_TULIP,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}

function garden(flowers:  number)  {
	sunflower()
	cornflower()
	tulip()
}
player.onChat("plant",  function  ()  {
	garden(1)
})
```

## Step 2

Next, write a single line comment for the function garden. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
//The function sunflower gives the agent 1 sunflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function sunflower()  {
	agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function cornflower gives the agent 1 cornflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function cornflower ()  {
	agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function tulip gives the agent 1 tulip in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function tulip ()  {
	agent.setItem(RED_TULIP,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function garden calls the functions of sunflower, cornflower, and tulip. 
function garden(flowers:  number)  {
	sunflower()
	cornflower()
	tulip()
}
player.onChat("plant",  function  ()  {
	garden(1)
})
```

## Step 3

Lastly, write a multi-line comment for the on chat command.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
//The function sunflower gives the agent 1 sunflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function sunflower()  {
	agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function cornflower gives the agent 1 cornflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function cornflower ()  {
	agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function tulip gives the agent 1 tulip in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
function tulip ()  {
	agent.setItem(RED_TULIP,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}
//The function garden calls the functions of sunflower, cornflower, and tulip. 
function garden(flowers:  number)  {
	sunflower()
	cornflower()
	tulip()
}
/*The chat command will call the function garden when the player types plant in the chat.  When the function garden is called, it calls the functions sunflower, cornflower, and tulip and has the agent plant all 3 flowers. */
player.onChat("plant",  function  ()  {
	garden(1)
})
```
