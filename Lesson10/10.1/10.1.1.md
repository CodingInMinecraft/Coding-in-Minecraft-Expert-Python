# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 11 Activity 2
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

We are going to continue writing comments for our code.  The code below uses functions to plant a garden.  Run the code to see how it works. 

First, write a comment for the function sunflower, cornflower, and tulip. Put the command above the function it is documenting. 

```template
function sunflower()  {
	agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}

function cornflower ()  {
	agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}

function tulip ()  {
	agent.setItem(RED_TULIP,  1,  1)
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}

function garden(flowers:  number)  {
	sunflower()
	cornflower()
	tulip()
}
player.onChat("plant",  function  ()  {
	garden(1)
})
```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
# The function sunflower gives the agent 1 sunflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def sunflower():
    agent.set_item(SUNFLOWER, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function cornflower gives the agent 1 cornflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def cornflower():
    agent.set_item(CORNFLOWER, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function tulip gives the agent 1 tulip in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def tulip():
    agent.set_item(RED_TULIP, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
def garden(flowers: number):
    sunflower()
    cornflower()
    tulip()

def on_on_chat():
    garden(1)
player.on_chat("plant", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 2

Next, write a comment for the function garden. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
# The function sunflower gives the agent 1 sunflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def sunflower():
    agent.set_item(SUNFLOWER, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function cornflower gives the agent 1 cornflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def cornflower():
    agent.set_item(CORNFLOWER, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function tulip gives the agent 1 tulip in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def tulip():
    agent.set_item(RED_TULIP, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function garden calls the functions of sunflower, cornflower, and tulip. 
def garden(flowers: number):
    sunflower()
    cornflower()
    tulip()

def on_on_chat():
    garden(1)
player.on_chat("plant", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 3

Lastly, write a comment for the on chat command.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
# The function sunflower gives the agent 1 sunflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def sunflower():
    agent.set_item(SUNFLOWER, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function cornflower gives the agent 1 cornflower in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def cornflower():
    agent.set_item(CORNFLOWER, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function tulip gives the agent 1 tulip in slot 1 and has the agent place it down and then move forward by 1. 
def tulip():
    agent.set_item(RED_TULIP, 1, 1)
    agent.place(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
# The function garden calls the functions of sunflower, cornflower, and tulip. 
def garden(flowers: number):
    sunflower()
    cornflower()
    tulip()
#The chat command will call the function garden when the player types plant in the chat.  
#When the function garden is called, it calls the functions sunflower, cornflower, and tulip and has the agent plant all 3 flowers. 

def on_on_chat():
    garden(1)
player.on_chat("plant", on_on_chat)

```
