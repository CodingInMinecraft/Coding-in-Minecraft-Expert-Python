## Step 1 @unplugged

In programming, there are events. 
**An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.** When an event occurs, it often provides some data (input) to the program. For example, when you click a button on a webpage, that's an event. The action of clicking triggers an event, and the program responds accordingly. The data associated with the event might include information about where you clicked or what button was pressed.
Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.

**In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control.**
In event-driven programming, the flow of control doesn't follow a strict linear sequence from one line of code to the next. Instead, program statements are executed in response to events as they occur. The program waits for events to happen, and when they do, the corresponding code is executed. 

This allows for more dynamic and interactive programs where actions happen in response to user interactions or other external factors.
