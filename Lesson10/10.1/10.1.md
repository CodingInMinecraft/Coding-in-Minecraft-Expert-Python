## Step 1@unplugged

**Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.**
Program documentation helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements and purposes of program documentation:

.1.  **Function and Purpose:** Documentation outlines the primary purpose and intended functionality of the code segment, event, procedure, or program. It explains what the software is designed to do and its role within the larger system.
    
2.  **Code Explanation:** Documentation offers a detailed explanation of the code's logic, structure, and algorithms. It breaks down complex sections of code into manageable parts, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the codebase.
    
3.  **Usage Instructions:** Documentation provides instructions on how to use the code or software. This includes information on input formats, parameters, expected outputs, and any relevant usage examples. Proper usage instructions help other developers integrate the code correctly into their projects.
    
4.  **Dependencies and Requirements:** Documentation lists any external libraries, frameworks, or resources that the code relies on. It also outlines the hardware or software requirements for running the code successfully. 

5. **Contributor Guidelines:**
It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original authorâ€™s name.
    
  

## Step 2 @unplugged
Programmers should document a program throughout its development. The often do this through comments. 
**Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people and do not affect how a program runs.**

*Note  - Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required.*

In Python, comments start with # and continue until the end of the line.


## Step 3

Let' practice creating comments in your code. 

There is a code on your workspace.  Run it to see what it does. 

```template
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		agent.move(BACK,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	}
})

```

## Step 4

Now, add a comment directly above the agent set Item code that explains what that line of code is doing. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    # The code below gives the agent 64  stone blocks in slot 1. 
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    for index in range(2):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.move(BACK, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
player.on_chat("wall", on_on_chat)


```

## Step 5

Next, add a comment directly above the loop describing what happens in the loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_on_chat():
    # The code below gives the agent 64  stone blocks in slot 1. //
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    #In the loop below, the agent will place as it walks forward by 3, up by 1, back by 3, and then up by 1 to build a wall. 
    #It will repeat those steps 2 times and build a 4 x 4 wall 
    
    for index in range(2):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.move(BACK, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
player.on_chat("wall", on_on_chat)


```

## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 7 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat and type wall.  
3. You will know your code is correct when your agent builds the wall.  When you run the code, your code should NOT effect the building of the wall.

## Step 8

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity zone.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
