## Step 1 @unplugged

In Python, **a syntax error** refers to a mistake or issue in the code that violates the language's rules and structure. Python has specific syntax rules that must be followed for the code to be properly understood and executed. Therefore, if there is a syntax error, **the code will not run**. 

 In MakeCode, when there are syntax errors, the coding editor will tell you and give you some information as to what the error is.  An example of this is below.

## Step 2

In the code below there are 2 syntax errors. 

The first one is on line 6.  Find the error and fix it. 

```template
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	for  (let index =  0; index <  5; index++)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1
		}
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(UP,  1
    }
})
```

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
def on_on_chat():
    for index in range(5):
        agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
        agent.set_item(BRICKS, 64, 1)
        for index2 in range(3):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(UP, 1
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 3

The second error is on line 9.  Fix the error. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
def on_on_chat():
    for index in range(5):
        agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
        agent.set_item(BRICKS, 64, 1)
        for index2 in range(3):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 5 @unplugged

2. Open the chat and type run  
3. You know your code is correct when your agent builds a 4x5 wall.

## Step 6

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If there are errors, try again.
