## Step 1 @unplugged

In JavaScript, **a syntax error** refers to a mistake or issue in the code that violates the language's rules and structure. JavaScript has specific syntax rules that must be followed for the code to be properly understood and executed. Therefore, if there is a syntax error, **the code will not run**. 

 In MakeCode, when there are syntax errors, the coding editor will tell you and give you some information as to what the error is.  An example of this is below.

## Step 2

In the code below there are 2 syntax errors. 

The first one is on line 9.  Find the error and fix it. 

```template
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	for  (let index =  0; index <  5; index++)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(UP,  1
	
})
```

```javascript 
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	for  (let index =  0; index <  5; index++)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	
})
```

## Step 3

The second error is on line 10.  Fix the error. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	for  (let index =  0; index <  5; index++)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	}
})
```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 6

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If there are errors, try again.
