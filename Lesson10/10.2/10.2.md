## Step 1 @unplugged

There are different types of errors in code. 
A **logic error** is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.

A **syntax error** is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.

A **run-time error** is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own run-time errors.

An **overflow error** is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values.
Let's look into each of these error types individually. 

## Step 2 @unplugged

Logic errors in JavaScript, also known as "bugs," occur when the code does not behave as intended due to flaws in the program's logic. Unlike syntax errors, which result from incorrect language usage, logic errors lead to unexpected outcomes that may not trigger any error messages. Here are a few examples of logic errors you may see in your code. 

**Incorrect Conditions or Expressions:** Logic errors often arise from mistakes in conditions or expressions used in conditional statements (if, else if, else) and loops (for, while). Incorrectly evaluating conditions can cause the code to take the wrong path or loop more or fewer times than intended.

**Off-by-One Errors:** These errors occur when iterating through arrays or other data structures, and the loop runs one too many or too few times. This often happens due to using the wrong comparison operator or mismanaging array indices.

**Misunderstanding Operator Precedence:** JavaScript operators have precedence rules that determine how expressions are evaluated. Mixing operators without considering their precedence can lead to incorrect results.

## Step 3

The code below is supposed to make a 4x4 solid square on the grass when the player types run but it has a 3 logic errors.  Run the code first to see what it it currently does. 

```template
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(GOLD_BLOCK, 64, 1)
		agent.place(BACK)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		}
	}
})
```

## Step 4

Now, fix the 3 errors. The first error that the agent needs to inspect for grass down instead of forward. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(GOLD_BLOCK, 64, 1)
		agent.place(BACK)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		}
	}
})
```

## Step 5
The next error is that the agent doesn't need to place Back.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(GOLD_BLOCK, 64, 1)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		}
	}
})
```

## Step 6
The last error is the for loop runs 1 to many times
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
		agent.setItem(GOLD_BLOCK, 64, 1)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
			agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		}
	}
})
```

2. Open the chat and type run  
3. You know your code is correct when your agent builds a solid 4x4 square on the ground.

## Step 9

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 
If there are errors, try again.
