# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 11 Activity 6

## Step 1 @unplugged

A **runtime error** in JavaScript occurs when the code is syntactically correct and successfully parsed by the JavaScript engine, but an issue arises while the code is executing during runtime.
When a runtime error occurs, it interrupts the normal flow of the program and can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

Here are some examples of runtime errors. 

 - **Reference Error**: This occurs when you try to access a variable or function that is not defined.
 - **Range Error:** This happens when a function receives an argument outside the expected range.
 - **Infinite Loop:** Creating a loop that never terminates can lead to a runtime error and potentially crash the browser or the environment where the code is running

## Step 2

The code below has 1 reference error and 1 infinite loop error.  Find the errors and fix the code. (For the infinite loop, change it to loop 4 times.)

```template
loops.forever(function  ()  {
	mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(-3,  4,  0))
	animal +=  1
})
if  (animal ==  4)  {
	player.say("That's enough!")
}
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let animal =  0
for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
	mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(-3,  4,  0))
	animal +=  1
}
if  (animal ==  4)  {
	player.say("That's enough!")
}
```

## Step 3

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 4 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  You know your code is correct when you see 4 chickens spawned and your player says That's enough!


## Step 5 @unplugged

In JavaScript, numbers have a limited range they can go up to. When you perform calculations or operations that cause a number to go beyond this maximum or minimum value, you get what's called an **overflow error.**

In Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft, an overflow error can occur when you're working with numbers or variables that exceed the maximum or minimum values that can be represented. This can happen when dealing with various game mechanics, calculations, or interactions within the Minecraft environment.

We won't be practicing any overflow errors during this lesson.
