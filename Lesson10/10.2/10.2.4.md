## Step 1

Practice using your debugging techniques by debugging the code below. The code should build the walls of a 6x6 house that is 3 blocks high. 

There are 5 errors.  If you need help, click next to go to the next step. 

```template
function _on_on_chat) {
  for (let x = 1; x < 5; x++) {
    agent.move(UP, 1)
    for (let y = 0; y < 6; y++) {
      for (let z = 0; z < 7; z++) {
        agent.set_item(BRICKS, 64, 1);
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1);
        agent.place(DOWN);
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN);
      
    }
  }
}

player.on_chat("build", on_on_chat

```

## Step 2

There are 5 errors on lines 2, 4, 5, and 10. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
def on_on_chat():
    for x in range(1, 4):
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        for y in range(4):
            for z in range(5):
                agent.set_item(BRICKS, 64, 1)
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
                agent.place(DOWN)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
player.on_chat("build", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 3
