## Step 1

Practice using your debugging techniques by debugging the code below. The code should build the walls of a 6x6 house that is 3 blocks high. 

There are 5 errors.  If you need help, click next to go to the next step. 

```template
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	for  (let x =  1; x <  5; x++  {
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		for  (let y =  0; y <  6; y++)  {
			for  (let z =  0; z <  7; z++)  {
				agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
				agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
				agent.place(DOWN)
			
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		}
	}
})

```

## Step 2

3 of the errors are logic errors.  
These 3 errors are on line 2, 4, and 5. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	for  (let x =  1; x <  4; x++  {
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		for  (let y =  0; y <  4; y++)  {
			for  (let z =  0; z <  5; z++)  {
				agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
				agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
				agent.place(DOWN)
			
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		}
	}
})
```

## Step 3

The other 2 errors are on lines 2 and 10 and are syntax errors.  


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	for  (let x =  1; x <  4; x++)  {
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		for  (let y =  0; y <  4; y++)  {
			for  (let z =  0; z <  5; z++)  {
				agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
				agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
				agent.place(DOWN)
			}
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		}
	}
})
```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.
