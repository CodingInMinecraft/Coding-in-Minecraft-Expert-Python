## Step 1 @unplugged

  

Loops are an important part of writing in Python. Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. Python supports multiple different kinds of loops including:
1. for
2. for/in
3. while

Let's take a look at at the common 'for' loop first. We can use a 'for' loop with a 'let' function to run a block of code repeatedly. 

In Python, in order to run a 'for' loop, the syntax we use is 'for i in range', and then define the number of loops.

This results in the the final code looking like this:

```python
  for i in range(5):

```

## Step 2

You are going to create a loop using the player.say command to count up to the number 10 in the chat. 
Begin with the words 'for i in range' and then a set of parentheses. Close it with a colon.

```python

for i in range():


```
 

## Step 3

The second condition will define a loop repeat amount. Make your loop repeat 10 times.

  
#### ~ tutorialhint
  
```python

for i in range(10):

```

## Step 4

Next, let's make our player say 'i'.

#### ~ tutorialhint

  ```python
for i in range(10):
    player.say(i)

```


## Step 5 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the text 0 through 9 appear on the screen. This is because the loop counted through numbers but did not go over 10 because the code called for less than 10.

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.
  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
