## Step 1 @unplugged

  

Loops are an important part of writing in JavaScript. Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. JavaScript supports multiple different kinds of loops including:
1. for
2. for/in
3. for/of
4. while
5. do/while

Let's take a look at at the common 'for' loop first. We can use a 'for' loop with a 'let' function to run a block of code repeatedly. 

In JavaScript, in order to run a 'for' loop, there are three things that need to be defined. Let's called them "conditions".
1: Condition 1 will set a variable before the loop begins
		ex. let i=0
2: Condition 2 defines the condition for the loop to be run
		ex. i<5
3. Condition 3 is increases a value (i++) of the variable each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

This results in the the final code looking like this:

```javascript
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)

```

## Step 2

You are going to create a loop using the player.say command to count up to the number 10 in the chat. 
Begin with the word for and then a parentheses.  The first condition in the parentheses is creating a variable named 1 with the value of 0. Finish the variable with a semicolon symbol.

```javascript

for (let i=0;


```
 

## Step 3

The second condition will define a loop repeat amount. Using a less than operator, add that i is less than 10. Add a semicolon after condition 2.

```javascript

for(let i=0; i<10;

```

## Step 4

Next, we need to define condition 3 by addition in an increasing expression (i++), and closing the parentheses. After the parentheses add a bracket. Then, inside the bracket have the player say the variable of i. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

  ```javascript

for(let i=0;i<10;i++) {

player.say(i)
}
```

To test your code:

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the text 0 through 9 appear on the screen. This is because the loop counted through numbers but did not go over 10 because the code called for less than 10.

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.
  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
