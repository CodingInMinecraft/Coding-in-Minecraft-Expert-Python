# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 5 Activity 5

## Step 1 

For this activity, we are going to use a while loop to have the agent plant a field of sunflowers. 

First, we want the to create an on chat command named plant. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 2

Next, inside the chat command, we want the agent to continue to plant as long as it does not detect a block in front of it.  Here is the code for that:

!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))

Place the above code inside the while loop. 

Then inside the while loop, use the agent set assist code to give the agent 64 sunflowers in slot 1

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER, 64, 1)
        }
  
})
```

## Step 3
Inside the while loop have the use the agent set assist code to turn place on move to true and then have the agent move forward by 1. Then close the while loop. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
    while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }

})
```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

2. You will know your code is correct when the agent plants 1 row of sunflowers. 
3. When your code works as expected, return to the activity to continue on. 


## Step 5
We planted 1 row, but we want to make a code to plant all 10.  
After the while loop, have the agent turn left, move forward by 1 and then move left again. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)

})
```

## Step 6

Now, we want to create another while loop, exactly the same as the first one. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
    while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }

})
```

## Step 7 
This time, we want the agent to turn right, move forward by 1 and then turn right again. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    
  })
```
## Step 8
Now, we have created code to plant 2 rows. There are 10 total rows.  Instead of repeating all of this code again, we can nest this code inside another type of loop, the for loop. **A nested loop is a loop inside another loop.** 
Add a for loop above the first while loop and close it after the last agent turn right. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    }

})
```
## Step 9
Lastly, have the agent move up after you close out the for loop to have the agent move out of the rows and plant one last sunflower. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("plant", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setItem(SUNFLOWER, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        while (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD))) {
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    }
    agent.move(UP, 1)
})
```

## Step 12

When your code works as expected, move on to the next NPC. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
