# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 5 Activity 6
### @explicitHints true

  

## Step 1 
In this activity, we are going to work with nested loops by using our for and while loops along with if / elif statements to have the agent mine, collect, and identify the blocks it mines.  First let's start with an on chat command named mine.  
You also need to count the size of both the length and width of the area the agent will be mining.
Inside the chat command, create a for loop that loops 7 times.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        pass
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)
```


## Step 2

Next, you need another for loop inside the first.  This for loop will repeat 14 times.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            pass
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 3
Inside the inner for loop, we want the agent to move forward by 1.  This will move the agent the length of the area. 
Then, you want a while loop that says while the agent is detecting a block forward. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                pass
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)
```


## Step 4
Inside the while loop, add an if /elif statement.  The if checks if the agent inspects a block forward and that block equals to Oak Planks.  If that condition is true, the agent will destroy forward, collect all, and the player will say "oak planks."



#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 5

Now, add an elif section that checks if the agent inspects a diamond ore block forward then the agent will destroy forward, collect all, and the player will say diamond ore. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 6
Add a third elif section that checks if the agent inspects a gold ore block forward, then the agent will destroy forward, collect all, and the player will say gold ore. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)

```


## Step 7
Add one more elif section that checks if the agent inspects a grass block forward, then the agent will destroy forward, collect all, and the player will say grass.  Then you will close out the inner for loop. 
(Remember - due to an error with the grass block, you need to use this code for this step: agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):)

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)
```


## Step 8
The code we have now will only get the agent down a row. The agent needs to turn left, destroy forward, move forward by 1,turn left again, the destroy forward again. Now it will be ready to move down the next row.  This needs to happen while still inside the first for loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for index in range(15):
        for index2 in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
                else:
                    player.say("no block")
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 9
To continue, you need to create another for loop, exactly like the inner for loop from your above code, with all of the same information inside.  You can duplicate the code to do this quickly. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for index in range(15):
        for index2 in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
                else:
                    player.say("no block")
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        for index3 in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
                else:
                    player.say("no block")
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 10
 Next, you need to make the agent turn right, destroy forward, move forward by 1, and then turn right again. This code needs to be inside the outer for loop. Close the outer for loop and the on chat command. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        for index2 in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif aagent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)


```

## Step 11
Lastly, because this was an odd number row, we need the agent to go down the last row.  Do the same for loop as the two inner for loops after outside all the loops but still inside the chat command. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def on_on_chat():
    for i in range(7):
        for index in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        for index2 in range(14):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
                if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("oak planks")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("diamond ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("gold ore")
                elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                    agent.collect_all()
                    player.say("grass")
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    for index3 in range(14):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD):
            if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == PLANKS_OAK:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                agent.collect_all()
                player.say("oak planks")
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == DIAMOND_ORE:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                agent.collect_all()
                player.say("diamond ore")
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE:
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                agent.collect_all()
                player.say("gold ore")
            elif agent.inspect(AgentInspection.DATA, DOWN) == blocks.block_by_name("grass_block"):
                agent.destroy(FORWARD)
                agent.collect_all()
                player.say("grass")
player.on_chat("mine", on_on_chat)

```
