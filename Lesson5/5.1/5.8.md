# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 5 Activity 5.8
### @explicitHints true

  


## Step 1

For this activity, we will use the code from our previous activity, but change out the 'for' loops for 'while' loops. Use the template below to define the while loops. Your desired result is that the while loops count and display the desired mined block.


```template


mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

target_block = blocks.DIAMOND_ORE
start_x = 10
start_z = 10
end_x = 20
end_z = 20
height = 64

x = start_x
while x <= end_x:
    z = start_z
    while z <= end_z:
        y = height
        while y >= 0:
            if mc.getBlock(x, y, z) == target_block:
                mc.player.collect(target_block)
                mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blocks.AIR)
            y -= 1
        z += 1
    x += 1


```

```python

target_block = blocks.DIAMOND_ORE
start_x = 10
start_z = 10
end_x = 20
end_z = 20
height = 64

mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()

for x in range(start_x, end_x + 1):
    for z in range(start_z, end_z + 1):
        for y in range(height, 0, -1):
            if mc.getBlock(x, y, z) == target_block:
                mc.player.collect(target_block)
                mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blocks.AIR)

```

## Step 2 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when your agent mines all of your desired blocks.
  
  
  

## Step 3

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
