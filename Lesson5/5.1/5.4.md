Another important loop to look at is the Python 'while' loop. The 'while' loop will allow a code to run until a specific condition is met. As long as the condition remains true, the code will run.


## Step 2
Let's write a code that uses a while loop.  First, declare a variable named count and assign it the value of 0.  Then write a while loop. 

To write a while loop, begin by typing the word while followed by your variable. Have the loop check for the conditional if while the count is less than 5. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

count = 0
while count < 5:
    pass
  
```

  

## Step 3

Next, under the while loop we want the player to say "This is iteration number count" where count is the variable. 
And we want to have the count variable to then increase by one. 

 #### ~ tutorialhint

```python 
count = 0
while count < 5:
    player.say("This is iteration number " + str(count))
    count += 1
```
  

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

2. You will know your code is correct when the player will say "This is the iteration 0", "This is the iteration 1", "This is the iteration 2", "This is the iteration 3", "This is the iteration 4"

## Step 6

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
