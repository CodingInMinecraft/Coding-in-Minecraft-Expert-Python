## Step 1 @unplugged

  We need to help the team lay down a foundation for the video game they are creating. Let's use the 'for' loop to place some blocks in a pattern. 



## Step 2

The code you began in the last activity made a row of 10.  Now that we know about agent.move and placing on move, let's try to expand. We want to make a foundation of sand with a 10x10 area. Right now, your agent is only making on line. Let's now create the code to make a 10 by 10 full area. The code from the last activity has already been put on the screen. 

First, because we will need more than 64 blocks, move the agent set item code into the for loop above the agent move code. 

After the agent moves forward, he needs to turn left,  move forward by 1, and then turn left again to get on the next row.  This needs to be outside and after of the for loop in your original code. 
  
```template

    agent.setItem(SAND,  64,  1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
    
    for  (let index =  0; index <  10; index++)  {
        agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
    
    }

```

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript


agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 10; index++) {
        agent.setItem(SAND, 64, 1)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)

```


## Step 3

Run the code to see what happens.  Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  See what happens when you run the code.
3.  After the code runs, press C and go to the next step. 


## Step 5 

What happened when you ran the code?  You should have seen that the agent placed 11 blocks. This is because it moves forward to the other row and places a block behind it as it moves. 
To fix this, change the for loop to less than 9 instead of 10. 

After that, add to the code to have the agent once again go forward by 9.  You can actually copy the for loop and paste it below the agent turn left block.  (Duplicating code is a way to be more efficient when coding.)


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript


agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
  for (let index = 0; index < 9; index++) {
        agent.setItem(SAND, 64, 1)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for (let index = 0; index < 9; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
    
```

## Step 6

When the agent gets to the end of that row, instead of turning left, the agent will need to turn right, move forward by 1, and turn right again.  Add that code below the second for loop. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript


agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
 for (let index = 0; index < 9; index++) {
    agent.setItem(SAND, 64, 1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
  for (let index = 0; index < 9; index++) {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)

```

## Step 7

Reset your area and then run the code to see what happens.  Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

3.  After the code runs, press C and go to the next step. 



## Step 9
How many rows did the agent make?  It should have made 2.  If you want to make a 10 x 10, you need to run this entire code 5 times.  You can place a for loop AROUND all of the code, starting with the first for loop. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript


agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
    for (let index = 0; index < 9; index++) {
        agent.setItem(SAND, 64, 1)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for (let index = 0; index < 9; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
}
```

## Step 12

When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
