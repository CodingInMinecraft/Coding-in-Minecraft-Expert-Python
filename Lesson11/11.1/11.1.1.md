# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 12 Activity 2
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
We are going to create code for a game that updates the score based on what block the player breaks.  If the score is not exactly equal to 10, a new random block will appear.  Each color block has a different value. 

Let's begin by creating a variable named score and assigning it the value of 0.  Then create a list named colors with the following blocks:
Yellow Stained Glass, Blue Stained Glass, Red Stained Glass, and Purple Stained Glass. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 

score = 0
colors = [YELLOW_STAINED_GLASS,
    BLUE_STAINED_GLASS,
    RED_STAINED_GLASS,
    PURPLE_STAINED_GLASS]

```

## Step 2

Create a function called newBlock.  Inside the function, create a blocks placed code, that will pick a Random color block from the colors list and place it at the following coordinate. (It will have the block be placed a random position anywhere in the activity zone.)

world(randint(-398,-404), 68, randint(196,190))


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 

score = 0
colors = [YELLOW_STAINED_GLASS,
    BLUE_STAINED_GLASS,
    RED_STAINED_GLASS,
    PURPLE_STAINED_GLASS]
def newBlock():
    blocks.place(colors._pick_random(),
        world(randint(-398, -404), 68, randint(196, 190)))

```

## Step 3

Now, we need to create an on blocks broken code for all of the different block colors.  Start with the Yellow Stained glass. 
Inside the on blocks broken code, have the score increase by 2. 
Then, create an if / else statement.  Have the statement check if the score is equal to 10.  If it is true, have the player say "You win with a score of " the variable score. 
If it doesn't equal 10, have the player say "Your score is" the variable score. And then call the function newBlock. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 

score = 0
colors = [YELLOW_STAINED_GLASS,
    BLUE_STAINED_GLASS,
    RED_STAINED_GLASS,
    PURPLE_STAINED_GLASS]
def newBlock():
    blocks.place(colors._pick_random(),
        world(randint(-398, -404), 68, randint(196, 190)))

def on_block_broken_yellow_stained_glass():
    global score
    score += 2
    if score == 10:
        player.say("You win with a score of " + str(score))
    else:
        player.say("Your score is " + str(score))
        newBlock()
blocks.on_block_broken(YELLOW_STAINED_GLASS, on_block_broken_yellow_stained_glass)


```

## Step 4

Next, you will create on blocks broken codes for the other stained glass colors in the list. All of the code for each color is the same as the yellow you created on the last step, except for the score change.  
For the blue stained glass have the score increase by 1. 
For the red stained glass, have the score increase by 3. 
For the purple stained glass, have the score decrease by 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 

score = 0
colors = [YELLOW_STAINED_GLASS,
    BLUE_STAINED_GLASS,
    RED_STAINED_GLASS,
    PURPLE_STAINED_GLASS]
def newBlock():
    blocks.place(colors._pick_random(),
        world(randint(-398, -404), 68, randint(196, 190)))

def on_block_broken_yellow_stained_glass():
    global score
    score += 2
    if score == 10:
        player.say("You win with a score of " + str(score))
    else:
        player.say("Your score is " + str(score))
        newBlock()
blocks.on_block_broken(YELLOW_STAINED_GLASS, on_block_broken_yellow_stained_glass)

def on_block_broken_blue_stained_glass():
    global score
    score += 1
    if score == 10:
        player.say("You win with a score of " + str(score))
    else:
        player.say("Your score is " + str(score))
        newBlock()
blocks.on_block_broken(BLUE_STAINED_GLASS, on_block_broken_blue_stained_glass)

def on_block_broken_red_stained_glass():
    global score
    score += 3
    if score == 10:
        player.say("You win with a score of " + str(score))
    else:
        player.say("Your score is " + str(score))
        newBlock()
blocks.on_block_broken(RED_STAINED_GLASS, on_block_broken_red_stained_glass)

def on_block_broken_purple_stained_glass():
    global score
    score += -1
    if score == 10:
        player.say("You win with a score of " + str(score))
    else:
        player.say("Your score is " + str(score))
        newBlock()
blocks.on_block_broken(PURPLE_STAINED_GLASS, on_block_broken_purple_stained_glass)

```

## Step 5

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 6 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  Play the game by breaking blocks.  
3.  You will know your code is correct when the player says your score after each block broken and randomly spawns a blocks when the score is not 10.  When the score is 10, your player will say "You win with a score of 10."
