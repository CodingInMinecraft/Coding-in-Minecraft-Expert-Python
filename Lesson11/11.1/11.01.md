**Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device.** 
When a program processes data or performs tasks, it generates results or outcomes. These results, often referred to as "outputs," are the data that the program sends to a device for users to perceive. Just as you might receive a printed document from a printer or see an image on a screen, these are examples of program outputs.

## Step 2 @unplugged

**Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.**
Program outputs can take different forms to cater to various human senses and interactions.

 For instance,

 - **Tactile outputs** involve physical sensations, like a controller
   vibrating in a video game. 
   
 - **Audio outputs** involve sounds, such as the music playing from your speakers. 
 - **Visual outputs** are images, graphics, videos, or anything you see on a screen. 
 - **Textual outputs** involve written or displayed information, like the words on a webpage or in a document.

## Step 3 @unplugged

**Program output is usually based on a programâ€™s input or prior state (e.g., internal values).** When you provide specific data or instructions as input to a program, it processes that input to produce a corresponding output.
Additionally, a program's output can depend on its internal state, which includes variables, calculations, and decisions made during its execution. For example, a game's output might change based on the player's score or progress, reflecting the program's prior state.
