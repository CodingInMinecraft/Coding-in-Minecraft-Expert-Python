# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 12 Activity 4
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
In this last practice activity, we are going to create a code to dig a 4 x 4 x 2 pond and fill it with water and fish. 
Start by declaring a variable named pond and assign it the value of 0. 
Then create a list called fish with the following items inside:
Axolotl
Tropical Fish
Pufferfish

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]

```

## Step 2
Next, create a function called dig.  Inside the function, have the agent do the following: 
Move forward by 1
Destroy Down
Move Down by 1
Destroy Down

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)

```

## Step 3
Still inside the dig function create a for loop that loops 3 times.  Inside the loop, have the agent do the following:
Destroy Forward
Destroy Down
Move Forward by 1
Destroy Down
Then close the loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)

```

## Step 4
After the loop, still inside the dig function, have the agent do the following:
Turn Left
Destroy Forward
Destroy Down
Move Forward by 1
Destroy Down
Turn Left

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)

```

## Step 5
Next, we need another for loop, exactly like the one you previously created.  For efficiency, you can copy and paste the code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)

```

## Step 6
After the second for loop, have the agent do the following:
Turn Right
Destroy Forward
Destroy Down
Move Forward by 1
Destroy Down
Turn Right

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
```

## Step 7
Next add another for loop, exactly like the other 2. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    for index3 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
```

## Step 8
After the third for loop, have the agent do the following:
Turn Left
Destroy Forward
Destroy Down
Move Forward by 1
Destroy Down
Turn Left


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    for index3 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
```

## Step 9
For the last part of the function, add 1 more for loop exactly like the others in the function. Then close the function. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    for index3 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index4 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
```

## Step 10
Now, create an on chat command named start that calls the function dig. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    for index3 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index4 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)

def on_on_chat():
    dig()
player.on_chat("start", on_on_chat)
```

## Step 11

Next, we want to create an on item interacted code that runs when the player uses a water bucket. 
Inside the code, spawn a random fish from the fish list at the pos of (0,0,0).


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    for index3 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index4 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)

def on_on_chat():
    dig()
player.on_chat("start", on_on_chat)

def on_item_interacted_water_bucket():
    mobs.spawn(fish._pick_random(), pos(0, 0, 0))
player.on_item_interacted(WATER_BUCKET, on_item_interacted_water_bucket)

```
## Step 12
Still in the on Item interacted code, have the variable pond increase by 1. Then create an If / Else statement that does the following: 
If the variable pond is equal to 5, the player says "That's enough fish in the pond." Else the player will say "You have" the variable pond "fish." 
Then close the on item interacted code. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
pond = 0
fish = [AXOLOTL, TROPICAL_FISH, PUFFERFISH]
def dig():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(DOWN, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    for index in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index2 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    for index3 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.destroy(DOWN)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    for index4 in range(3):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.destroy(DOWN)

def on_on_chat():
    dig()
player.on_chat("start", on_on_chat)

def on_item_interacted_water_bucket():
    global pond
    mobs.spawn(fish._pick_random(), pos(0, 0, 0))
    pond += 1
    if pond == 5:
        player.say("That's enough fish in the pond. ")
    else:
        player.say("You have " + str(pond) + "fish")
player.on_item_interacted(WATER_BUCKET, on_item_interacted_water_bucket)

```

## Step 13
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 14 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

2. Open the chat and type start.  
3. You will know your code is correct when the agent digs a 4x4x2 hole. 
   ![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson12/12.1/12.1.2.png?raw=true  "code")
4. Then, take your player into the pond and pour water buckets.  You should see you player tell you how many fish you have until you get to 5 and then it will tell you that you have enough fish in the pond. 

## Step 15
When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC. 
If there are errors, try again.
