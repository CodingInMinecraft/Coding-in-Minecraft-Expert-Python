# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 12 Activity 1
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
Let's start practicing combining everything you have learned.  In this activity, you are going to set up a farm with 2 pens and some beehives. We are going to start by declaring the variables hay, hives, and mud and assigning them each the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0

```

## Step 2
Next, create an array with the animals Bee, Cow, and Pig as the items in the list. 
Then create an object named pen with the following keys and values:
woodType - oak fence
length - 6
width - 6

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,

```

## Step 3
Still inside the the object, create a key of buildPen where the value is a function. 
Inside the function create a for loop that loops 2 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {

```

## Step 4
Inside the for loop have the agent set 64 of the  pen.woodType item in slot 1. Also have destroy obstacles and place on move set to true.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
   
```


## Step 5
Still inside the for loop, have the agent move forward the length of the pen and then turn left. Then have the agent move forward by the width of the pen and then turn left again. Then close the for loop. Outside of the for loop, have the agent move back by 1. Then close the for loop and the function. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)

    }
}

```
## Step 6
Now, we want to create an on chat command named build. Inside the chat command, call the function buildPen. 
Create a second on chat command named tp and have the agent teleport to the player inside that chat command. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}

player.onChat("build", function () {
    pen.buildPen ()
})

player.onChat("tp", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})


```

## Step 7
Next, create an on blocks placed code for the block of Mud. Inside the on blocks placed code, have the variable mud increase by 1 and create an if / else statement.  Have the if statement check if mud is greater than or equal to 2. If it is true, spawn 3 of the animals that is in the 2nd place of the animals array at this position (2,0,0).
If it is false, have the player say "This pen needs more mud!"

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}

player.onChat("build", function () {
    pen.buildPen ()
})

player.onChat("tp", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})

blocks.onBlockPlaced(MUD, function () {
    mud += 1
    if (mud >= 2) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[2], pos(2, 0, 0))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more mud!")
    }
})

```


## Step 8
Now you need to create an on blocks placed code for the block of hay. Inside the on blocks placed code, have the variable hay increase by 1 and create an if / else statement.  Have the if statement check if hay is equal to 4. If it is true, spawn 3 of the animals that is in the 1st place of the animals array at this position (2,0,0).
If it is false, have the player say "This pen needs more hay!"

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}

player.onChat("build", function () {
    pen.buildPen ()
})

player.onChat("tp", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})

blocks.onBlockPlaced(MUD, function () {
    mud += 1
    if (mud >= 2) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[2], pos(2, 0, 0))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more mud!")
    }
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(HAY_BLOCK, function () {
    hay += 1
    if (hay == 4) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[1], pos(2, 0, 0))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more hay!")
    }
})

```

## Step 9
Lastly, create an on blocks placed code for a beehive. Inside the on blocks placed code, have the variable hives increase by 1 and create an if / else statement.  Have the if statement check if hives is greater than or equal to 3. If it is true, spawn 4 of the animal that is in the 0 place of the animals array at this position (2,0,0).
If it is false, have the player say "You need more bee hives!"

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 6,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}

player.onChat("build", function () {
    pen.buildPen ()
})

player.onChat("tp", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})

blocks.onBlockPlaced(MUD, function () {
    mud += 1
    if (mud >= 2) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[2], pos(2, 0, 0))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more mud!")
    }
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(HAY_BLOCK, function () {
    hay += 1
    if (hay == 4) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[1], pos(2, 0, 0))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more hay!")
    }
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BEEHIVE, function () {
    hives += 1
    if (hives >= 3) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[0], pos(2, 0, 0))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("You need more bee hives!")
    }
})
```

2. Open the chat and type build.
3. You know it is correct when your agent builds a 6 x 6 pen. 
   ![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson12/12.1/12.1.png?raw=true  "code")
4. Then, move the player into the pen and place down 2 blocks of mud. 
5. You will know the code worked when 3 pigs then spawn into the pen. 
6. Then move to the next open space where the 2nd pen will be build and use the chat command tp to move the agent to your position.
7. Open the chat and type build.
8. You know it is correct when your agent builds a 6 x 6 pen. 
9.  Then, move the player into the pen and place down 4 hay bales along the edge of the pen. 
10. You will know the code worked when 2 cows are spawned into the pen. 
11. Lastly, place down 3 beehives anywhere in the area (but not in the pen.)
12. You will know your code is correct when bees are spawned in the area.
