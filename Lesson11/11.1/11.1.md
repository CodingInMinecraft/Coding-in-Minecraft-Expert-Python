# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 12 Activity 1
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
Let's start practicing combining everything you have learned.  In this activity, you are going to set up a farm with 2 pens and some beehives. We are going to start by declaring the variables hay, hives, and mud and assigning them each the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0

```

## Step 2
Next, create an array with the animals Bee, Cow, and Pig as the items in the list. 
Then create an object named pen with the following keys and values:
woodType - oak fence
length - 6
width - 3

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,

```

## Step 3
Still inside the the object, create a key of buildPen where the value is a function. 
Inside the function create a for loop that loops 2 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {

```

## Step 4
Inside the for loop have the agent set 64 of the  pen.woodType item in slot 1. Also have destroy obstacles and place on move set to true.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
   
```


## Step 5
Still inside the for loop, have the agent move forward the length of the pen and then turn left. Then have the agent move forward by the width of the pen and then turn left again. Then close the for loop. Outside of the for loop do he following:
- Agent move back by 1.
- Agent Set Assist Place on Move set to False
- Agent move left by 6. 
- Agent move forward by 1.
  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
        agent.move(LEFT,6)
        agent.move(FORWARD,1)
    }
}

```
## Step 6
Next, repeat the for loop so the agent builds the second pen. Outside of the for loop have tha agent move back by 1 and then close the function. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
        agent.move(LEFT,6)
        agent.move(FORWARD,1)
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}
```

## Step 7
Now, we want to create an on chat command named build. Inside the chat command, call the function buildPen. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
        agent.move(LEFT,6)
        agent.move(FORWARD,1)
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}

player.onChat("build", function () {
    pen.buildPen ()
})
```

## Step 8
Next, create an on blocks placed code for the block of Mud. Inside the on blocks placed code, have the variable mud increase by 1 and create an if / else statement.  Have the if statement check if mud is greater than or equal to 2. If it is true, spawn 3 of the animals that is in the 2nd place of the animals array at this world position (-422, 67, 191).
If it is false, have the player say "This pen needs more mud!"

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
        agent.move(LEFT,6)
        agent.move(FORWARD,1)
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}

player.onChat("build", function () {
    pen.buildPen()
})

blocks.onBlockPlaced(MUD, function () {
    mud += 1
    if (mud >= 2) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[2], world(-422, 67, 191))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more mud!")
    }
})

```


## Step 9
Now you need to create an on blocks placed code for the block of hay. Inside the on blocks placed code, have the variable hay increase by 1 and create an if / else statement.  Have the if statement check if hay is equal to 4. If it is true, spawn 3 of the animals that is in the 1st place of the animals array at this world position (-415, 67, 191).
If it is false, have the player say "This pen needs more hay!"

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 
let hay = 0
let hives = 0
let mud = 0
let animals = [BEE, COW, PIG]
let pen = {
    woodType: OAK_FENCE,
    length: 6,
    width: 3,
    buildPen: function () {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)
        agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
        agent.move(LEFT,6)
        agent.move(FORWARD,1)
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, pen.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(BACK, 1)


    }

}

player.onChat("build", function () {
    pen.buildPen()
})

blocks.onBlockPlaced(MUD, function () {
    mud += 1
    if (mud >= 2) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[2], world(-422, 67, 191))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more mud!")
    }
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(HAY_BLOCK, function () {
    hay += 1
    if (hay == 4) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[1], world(-415, 67, 191))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more hay!")
    }
})

```

## Step 10
Lastly, create an on blocks placed code for a beehive. Inside the on blocks placed code, have the variable hives increase by 1 and create an if / else statement.  Have the if statement check if hives is greater than or equal to 3. If it is true, spawn 4 of the animal that is in the 0 place of the animals array at this position (2,0,0).
If it is false, have the player say "You need more bee hives!"

            agent.setItem(pen.woodType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)

    }

}

            mobs.spawn(animals[2], world(-422, 67, 191))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more mud!")
    }
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(HAY_BLOCK, function () {
    hay += 1
    if (hay == 4) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[1], world(-415, 67, 191))
        }
    } else {
        player.say("This pen needs more hay!")
    }
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(BEE_NEST, function () {
    hives += 1
    player.say(hives)
    if (hives >= 3) {
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            mobs.spawn(animals[0], pos(2, 0, 0))
        }
