## Step 1 @unplugged

In Python, comparison operators are used to compare values, and return a Boolean value(true or false). Here are some examples of the different comparison operators in Python:

1. **equal to(==)** : The equality operator will check if two values are equal.
2. **not equal to (!=)** : the inequality operator checks if two values are NOT equal.
3. **strict equal to (===)** : the strict equality operator checks if two values are equal by comparing both the value and the data type.
4. **strict not equal to (!==)**: the strict inequality operator checks if two values are not equal by comparing both the value and the data type.
5. **greater than (>)** : the greater than operator check if the left operand is greater than the right operand
6. **less than (<)** : the less than operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand

Typically, comparison operators are used in conditional statement and comparisons to make decisions based on certain conditions. The goal of comparison operators is to return a Boolean value of true or false, to make decisions. 

## Step 2

Let's use a few different comparison operators and see what happens. For this activity, we will use the player.say command. First, have the player say (3>5) to test out the greater than operator. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
    player.say(3>5)
```

## Step 3 @unplugged
 To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct whenYou should see a Boolean response  of False in the chat. Return to this coding screen once you have successfully ran your code.

## Step 4

Great job. Your player should have said "false" when testing because three was greater than 5. 
Next, let's test a less than operator with the same numbers, in the same order, but use the less than operator (3 < 5). 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
    player.say(3<5)
```


## Step 5 @unplugged
Now let's test the code.
To test your code:

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

  
![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

  
2. You will know your code is correct when you should see a Boolean response  of True in the chat. Return to this coding screen once you have successfully ran your code.

## Step 6

Awesome! You should have seen that the player gave back a 'true' Boolean response, showing that 3 is less than 5. 

Lastly, use an equal to operator with the number 2 both times (2 == 2).  Then test your code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
    player.say(2 == 2)
```

## Step 7 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the text true in the chat.

## Step 8

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.
  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
