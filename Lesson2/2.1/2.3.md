## Step 1 @unplugged

  

**Logical Operators** are used to manipulate or combine Boolean (true or false) values. In JavaScript, we mostly use three logical operators:

1. AND(&&)

2. OR(||) *This key is the "pipe" symbol that shares with the back slash above the enter key on your keyboard*

3. NOT(!)

These logical operators perform operations on expressions, and will return Boolean values as a result. Continue on to see some of these operators in action.

## Step 2

The AND (&&) Operator will return true **only if both operands are true**, otherwise it will return false. Using the template below, let's test an AND operator by comparing two values from the variables below. Write in a player.say command, then use the logical operators to test by writing the code below in the parentheses of the player say chat. 

x>y && z>x

```template
let x=5
let y=7
let z=10


```

```javascript

    let x=5
    let y=7
    let z=10
    player.say(x>y&&z>x)
```


## Step 3 @unplugged 

Now let's test the code.
To test your code:

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when you should see a Boolean response  of False in the chat. Return to this coding screen once you have successfully ran your code.

## Step 4

You should have seen your player return false in the chat window. The AND operator needed both comparisons to be correct to return "true" to the console. Because even though z is greater than x, x is not greater than y.

The OR (||) Operator needs one operand or the other to be correct in order to do the same. Let's use the same variables as before, and test the OR operator. Just change the AND symbol to the OR symbol. 
Remember, the (||) key is (Pipe symbol) is located in the same key as the backslash key, above the enter key on the keyboard.

```javascript

    let x=5
    let y=7
    let z=10
    player.say(x>y || z>x)
   ```


## Step 5 @unplugged

Now let's test the code.
To test your code:

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when you should see a Boolean response  of true in the chat window. The OR operator needs only 1 of the conditions to be correct to return "true" to the console. Because even though z is greater than x and x is not greater than y, 1 of them was true so the whole thing returns true.

3. When your code is correct, continue to the next step. 
4. 
## Step 6 

Lastly, try the NOT operator.  When using the not operator, add a parentheses before the parentheses that the OR statement is in.  Then an exclamation mark.  Close out the parentheses AFTER the other closing parentheses. Then test the code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

    let x=5
    let y=7
    let z=10
    player.say(!(x>y || z>x))
   ```
## Step 7 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when you get back a Boolean in the chat of false because while the internal expression is true the not operator (!) makes it false.

## Step 8

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.
  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
