## Step 1 @unplugged

For our final operators practice, let's calculate the area of the structure in front of us. You will need to start by counting out the length and width of the structure. Once you have your count, continue to the next step.
 
## Step 2

To calculate our area, let's start by defining the length and width variables.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let length = 5
let width = 5

```
## Step 3

Now, lets use arithmetic operators to let the area equal length times width. Then, have your player say "The area of the structure is ( +area+) square blocks"

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let length = 5
let width = 5
let area = length * width
player.say("The area of the structure is " + area + " square blocks.")

```

## Step 5

If your code worked as expected move on to the next NPC. 
  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
