# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 2 Activity 5
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

Let's use what you learned and use it with the agent as well. 
First, declare 2 variables. One named build and one named score both with the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let build = 0
let score = 0

```


## Step 2 
Next, create an on chat command with the name build.  In the on chat command, first, use the set item code (see below for example) to give the agent 64 grass blocks in slot 1.  Then have the agent move forward by 1 and then have the agent place back. 

agent.setItem(GRASS,  64,  1)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let build = 0
let score = 0
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.setItem(GRASS,  64,  1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.place(BACK)

})
```


## Step 3
Still in the on chat command after the agent place back code, have the variable build increase by 1 and then have the variable score increase by 2. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let build = 0
let score = 0
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.setItem(GRASS,  64,  1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.place(BACK)
    build += 1
    score += 2

})
```


## Step 4
Next, we are going to give you the code to type in as it is something you haven't learned yet.  Type the following code in to build an if statement. 

if (build == 3) {

}



#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let build = 0
let score = 0
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.setItem(GRASS,  64,  1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.place(BACK)
    build += 1
    score += 2
    if (build == 3) {
        
    }
    
})
```

## Step 5
Inside the if statement brackets, have the variable score add to the value of the variable build. Then, after the close of the if statement brackets, have the player say the variable score.


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let build = 0
let score = 0
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.setItem(GRASS,  64,  1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.place(BACK)
    build += 1
    score += 2
    if (build == 3) {
        score + build
    }
    player.say(score)
})
```

## Step 6
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step. 

## Step 7 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat and type build 3 times. 

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the text first read 2, then 4, and then 6. And the agent will place down 2 blocks.

## Step 8

If your code worked as expected move on to the next NPC. 
  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
