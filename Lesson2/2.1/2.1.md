## Step 1 @unplugged

In JavaScript, operators are keywords or symbols that are used to perform various operations on values. These operations include performing arithmetic operations, assigning values, comparing values, and more!
The most common operations in JavaScript are:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Conditional(ternary) Operators


## Step 2 @unplugged
Arithmetic Operators are used to perform mathematical operations on number values. The operations are:
(+) Addition
(-) Subtraction
(*)Multiplication
(/) Division
(%)Modulus

Here's an example of what these may look like:


```javascript
    let x=13;
    let y=7;
    let z= x+y; // z will equal 20
    let a= x*y; // a will equal 91
    let b= x-y // b will equal 6
```

## Step 3
In the space below, let's use an arithmetic operator figure the area of a rectangle. Begin by declaring a variable width with the value of 3. Then declare a variable of length with the value of 5. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
    let width = 3
    let length = 5
```


## Step 4

Declare a variable of area and use the multiplication operator to multiply length times width as the value. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
    let width = 3
    let length = 5
    let area = length * width
```


## Step 5

Add a player.say command and have the player use an addition operator to add the string "The area of the rectangle is" and the variable area. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
    let width = 3
    let length = 5
    let area = length * width
    player.say("The area of the rectangle is" + area)
   
```

## Step 7

Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected mark yourself complete and move on to the next activity.

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
