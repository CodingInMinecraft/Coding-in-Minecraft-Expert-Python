### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

In this activity we will start to use Python to code in Minecraft.

  
## Step 2 @unplugged

**Making your Agent move**

 With code you can make your Agent move in one of 6 directions for a specified number of blocks:

- Forward

- Backwards

- Left

- Right

- Up

- Down

  

## Step 3

First, create an on chat command with the word run. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_on_chat():
    
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

  

## Step 4

Next, inside the on chat command, write the code to have the agent move forward by 1.  This code is written below for you. 

    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```
