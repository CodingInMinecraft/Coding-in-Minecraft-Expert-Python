# Review Lesson - Agent Build Activity 4

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

In this activity we will change our code from the previous activity to make the Agent place blocks in different directions.
 

## Step 2

After the agent place back code, have the agent then place left, right, forward and up to place blocks all around the Agent.
  

```template

def on_on_chat():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(UP, 3)
    agent.place(BACK)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(UP, 3)
    agent.place(BACK)
    agent.place(LEFT)
    agent.place(RIGHT)
    agent.place(FORWARD)
    agent.place(UP)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```
