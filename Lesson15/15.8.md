# Review Lesson - Agent Build Activity 3
### @explicitHints true
  

## Step 1 

We can create code that will allow us to specify where the agent will place a single block either back, forward, left, right, up or down.
After the agent move up by 3 code, have the agent place back. This code for place back is written below:

    agent.place(BACK)

```template

def on_on_chat():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(UP, 3)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(UP, 3)
    agent.place(BACK)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```
