# Review Lesson - Agent Build Activity 1

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 

In this activity we will start to learn to use code that will enable the Agent to build.
First code an on chat command. Inside the on chat command, write the code for an agent set assist to true. The code is below for your assistance. 

    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

  

## Step 2

After the place on move code, have the agent move forward by 3. 
 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```
