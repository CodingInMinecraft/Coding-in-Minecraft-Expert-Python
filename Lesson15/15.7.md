### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

In this activity we will change our code from the previous activity to make the Agent build in a different direction.


## Step 2

On the agent move forward by 3 code, change the direction the Agent will move to the Up direction.

```template

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(UP, 3)
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)
