## Step 1 @unplugged

**Summoning the Agent by Teleportation**
When you open Code Builder for the first time in a world the Agent will appear at your current position.

If you move away from that position there are 2 methods you can use to make your Agent move to close to you again.

In this activity we will discover how to teleport the Agent to your current position.

Move your player into the activity zone away from the agent.

 
## Step 2
Create a on chat command by typing the following code:

def on_on_chat():
    
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```

## Step 3
Next, inside the on chat command add the agent teleport to player code by typing the following code: 

    agent.teleport_to_player()

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python

def on_on_chat():
    agent.teleport_to_player()
player.on_chat("run", on_on_chat)

```
