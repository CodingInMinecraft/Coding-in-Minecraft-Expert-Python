## Step 1 @unplugged
The next step is the  **prototype phase**.  Prototypes can take various forms, from paper sketches to interactive digital models.  

The prototype phase is important for many reasons.  

**Testing Ideas Early:**

Prototyping lets designers try out their ideas before making the real thing. Instead of building a whole product right away, they create quick versions to see what works and what doesn't. This helps them make improvements early on.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Getting Feedback from Users:**

Designers use prototypes to ask real people what they think. By testing their ideas with users, they can find out what people like or don't like, making sure the final product is something people will love.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Making Changes Step by Step:**

Prototyping is like building with LEGO. Designers can try different pieces until they get it just right. They make small changes to their prototypes based on feedback, getting closer to the perfect design each time.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Avoiding Big Mistakes:**

Imagine finding a mistake after building something huge â€“ like realizing you put the door in the wrong place after building the whole house! Prototyping helps catch mistakes early, saving time and trouble later.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Showing Ideas Clearly:**

Prototypes are like sneak peeks of the final product. They help designers show their ideas to others in a way that's easy to understand. Whether it's a drawing or a model, prototypes help everyone see what's being made.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Saving Time and Money:**

It might seem like making prototypes takes extra time, but it actually saves time and money in the long run. Finding and fixing problems early means less work later. Plus, trying out different ideas quickly helps designers figure out the best way to make their product.
