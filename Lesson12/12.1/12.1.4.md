## Step 1 @unplugged

The last stage is **testing**. 

Testing is a vital step for many reasons.  

**Making Sure It Works:**

Imagine spending hours building something only to find out it doesn't work properly – that would be frustrating! Testing ensures that the design does what it's supposed to do. It's like checking all the pieces of a puzzle to make sure they fit together perfectly.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Finding and Fixing Mistakes:**

Even the best designs can have flaws. Testing helps uncover any mistakes or problems so they can be fixed before the product is released. It's like proofreading a paper before turning it in – you want to catch any errors before they become a big deal.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Ensuring User-Friendliness:**

A design might work perfectly fine, but if it's hard to use, people won't like it. Testing helps designers see how real users interact with their product and identify any areas that are confusing or frustrating. It's like asking your friends to try out a new game to see if they understand the rules.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Getting Feedback:**

Testing isn't just about finding bugs – it's also a chance to get feedback from real users. Designers can learn what people like or don't like about their product and use that feedback to make improvements. It's like asking for opinions on a new outfit to see if it looks good on you.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Building Confidence:**

Testing gives designers confidence that their product is ready to go out into the world. It's like practicing a dance routine before performing in front of an audience – you want to make sure you're prepared and can show off your best moves.

## Step 6 @unplugged

This stage is typically done AFTER the product is built so you will do this piece in the next lesson. 

However, it is a good idea to show your prototype to some of your classmates and get their feedback on what you have designed BEFORE you begin building the product.  Use the provided worksheet to get this feedback from your classmates. 

Once complete, upload it to the portal and move on to the next NPC for the next stage.
