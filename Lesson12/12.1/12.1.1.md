## Step 1 @unplugged

You are going to develop a program starting with the **Investigating and Reflecting Phase.**  During this time you need to think about the requirements, constraints, and goals of the program.  


Why is the investigate phase so important? Let's break it down:


**Figuring out the Problem**

Think of it as putting on your detective hat. Investigating helps us really understand the problem we're trying to solve. We want to make sure we're working on a problem that makes sense and matters.


## Step 2 @unplugged
**Putting Users First**

Imagine designing something without thinking about who will use it – that wouldn't be fun or helpful! Investigating lets us get into the minds of the people who will use what we create, so we can make things they'll love and find easy to use.

## Step 3 @unplugged

**Smart Decision-Making**

Before we start designing, we want to be smart about it. Investigating gives us a solid base of information to make good decisions. It's like having a map to guide us – we know where we're going and how to get there.

## Step 4 @unplugged

**Avoiding Trouble**

Nobody likes surprises, especially not in the middle of a project. Investigating helps us spot potential problems early on, so we can come up with plans to avoid them. It's like looking ahead to make sure the road is clear.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Getting Inspired**

The investigate phase is like opening a treasure chest of ideas. It's not just about solving problems; it's about getting inspired to create something amazing. By exploring different angles and possibilities, we can come up with cool and creative solutions.

## Step 6 @unplugged

Remember, the investigate phase is **where designers lay the groundwork for successful problem-solving and innovation.**
