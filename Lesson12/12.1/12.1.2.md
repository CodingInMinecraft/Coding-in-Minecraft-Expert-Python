## Step 1 @unplugged

The next phase is the **Design phase**. During this phase you will do the following. 
 - brainstorm
 - plan and storyboard
 - organize the program into modules and functional components
 - create diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
 - development of a testing strategy for the program
  
## Step 2 @unplugged
Why is this step so crucial?

**Efficiency**

Planning and organizing in the design phase save you a ton of time later on. It's like having a roadmap for building your program – you know where you're headed and how to get there.

## Step 3 @unplugged

**User Satisfaction**

Creating a well-thought-out user interface ensures that your program is easy to use and enjoyable. Users shouldn't feel like they need a manual to figure things out!

## Step 4 @unplugged

**Quality Assurance**

Developing a testing strategy is like putting your program through a trial run. It ensures that when your program goes live, it's as bug-free as possible. Nobody likes a glitchy app!

## Step 5 @unplugged

**Problem Prevention**

Imagine discovering a flaw in your design after you've built the whole thing – that would be a headache! The design phase helps catch potential problems early on, saving you from future headaches and extra work.

## Step 6 @unplugged

In a nutshell, the design phase sets the stage for a smooth and successful development process. It's the blueprint, the plan, and the quality check all rolled into one – making sure your program is not just functional but fantastic!
