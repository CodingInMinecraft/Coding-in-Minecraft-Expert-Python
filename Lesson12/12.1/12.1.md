## Step 1 @unplugged

You are going to use a development process for your program.  
A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.
These approaches reflect how a project is planned, executed, and progressed.

**Ordered and intentional** development processes involve a structured and planned process. The development team follows a predefined set of steps, tasks, and milestones.

**Exploratory development** processes are more flexible and adaptive. The team starts with a general direction or concept but allows for experimentation, creativity, and adaptation as the project progresses.

The choice between an ordered and intentional approach or an exploratory approach should be made based on factors such as project complexity, available resources, timeline constraints, and the level of uncertainty involved.

## Step 2 @unplugged
A development process can be iterative or incremental. 

A development process that is iterative **requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process.** This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.

A development process that is incremental is one that **breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole**.

As you have seen, there are multiple development processes.  However, the following phases are commonly used when developing a program: 

 - investigating and reflecting
 - designing
 - prototyping
 - testing

Let's go through each of these steps individually. 


## Step 3 @unplugged

**Investigating and Reflecting**

The investigating and reflecting step involves researching and gathering information to understand the problem or opportunity that the development process aims to address. 
It's important to identify the requirements, constraints, and goals of the project.
 **Program requirements** describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. 
Investigation in a development process is also useful for understanding and identifying the **program constraints**, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.

Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: 

 - collecting data through surveys 
 - user testing
 - interviews
 - direct observations

This phase helps in setting the foundation for the rest of the development process.

## Step 4 @unplugged

**Design Phase**

In a development process, the design phase **outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.** A programâ€™s specification defines the requirements for the program.

The design phase of a program may include: 

 - brainstorming
 - planning and storyboarding
 - organizing the program into modules and functional components
 - creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
 - development of a testing strategy for the program

## Step 5 @unplugged

**Prototyping**
Prototyping is a step that involves **creating a simplified, functional version of the product or solution.** This version, known as a prototype, allows stakeholders to see and interact with a tangible representation of the design. Prototypes can take various forms, from paper sketches to interactive digital models. The purpose of prototyping is to validate design decisions, test user interactions, and identify potential issues early in the development process. Feedback gathered from testing the prototype helps in refining the design before proceeding further.


## Step 6 @unplugged

**Testing**
In the development process, **testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes.** Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs.
Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes. Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing.

Therefore, testing should include a wide range of inputs, with a specific focus on inputs that challenge the program's boundaries. This helps identify and address potential issues, ensuring the program's robustness and reliability in real-world use.

Now that you understand more about the development process, go to the next NPC to begin working through the development process for your own program.
