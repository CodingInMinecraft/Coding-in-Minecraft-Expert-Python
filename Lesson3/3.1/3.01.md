The Internet is designed to be able to handle problems and keep working even if something goes wrong. It uses special methods for deciding how information should travel and be sent, which helps ensure that data gets to where it needs to go.

When a system can keep working even if some parts fail, we call it **fault-tolerant.** This is important because in complex systems, things can unexpectedly stop working, sometimes many at once. Fault tolerance is what allows us to keep using the network even when these failures happen.

## Step 2 @unplugged

**Redundancy:** The Internet has been designed with redundancy, which means there are **multiple paths for data to travel from one point to another.** This redundancy helps ensure that if one path or connection fails, data can still be routed through alternative paths. Think of it like having multiple roads to reach your destination, so if one road is blocked, you can still take a different route.

**Packet Switching:** Data sent over the Internet is divided into small packets. Each packet carries a piece of the information being sent. These packets are then individually routed across the network. This method is called packet switching. **It allows for efficient and reliable data transmission because if one packet encounters an issue or gets lost, it can be retransmitted separately without affecting the other packets.**
Having multiple ways to route data between two points makes the Internet more dependable and helps it work properly even if some routes encounter issues.
