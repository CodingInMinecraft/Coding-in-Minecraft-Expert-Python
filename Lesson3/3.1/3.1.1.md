# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 Activity 2

## Step 1

Let's continuing practicing with if statements but this time, let's work with our agent.  
We can use our agent to detect what type of block is below is feet.  If the block is grass, we can have him place a cornflower. 

First, let's give our agent the inventory he needs for this to work.  Below is the code to give your agent inventory. 

    agent.setItem(ITEM,  Amount,  Slot)

We always want to give the agent the inventory in Slot 1 as that is the default slot it pulls items from. 

Write the code below to give the Agent 64 Cornflowers in Slot 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)

```

## Step 2

Next, code the agent to move forward by 1.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)
agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
```

## Step 3

Now we want to add an if statement that says if the agent inspects down and the block under him is grass, he will place down. 
In order to do this, you will need to use the logic condition of equals (==).  

The code for the agent to inspect is below. 
agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, DIRECTION)

Last, outside the if Statement, have the agent move forward by 1 again. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)
agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
	 agent.place(DOWN)
     agent.move(FORWARD, 1)

}
```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

2.  You will know your code is correct when the agent moves forward by 1 and  places a cornflower on the grass block and then moves forward by 1 again.

## Step 6

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
