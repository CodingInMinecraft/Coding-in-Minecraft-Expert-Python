# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 Activity 3
### @explicitHints true


## Step 1

In this activity, we will use an if statement to write "Hello World!" in the sky after we place 4 gold blocks. 
Start by declaring the variable gold and assigning it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
``` javascript

let gold =  0

```

## Step 2

In this activity, we will use the event handler of on Block Placed.  Below is the code for that event. 

blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {

})

Add the on Blocks Placed code and change the block from Grass to Gold blocks. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let gold = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GOLD_BLOCK,function () 
{
    
})

```

## Step 3

After the on blocks placed code, create a code that increases the variable by 1 each time a gold block is placed inside the event. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let gold = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GOLD_BLOCK,function () 
{
    gold += 1
    
})


```

## Step 4

After the gold code, write an If Statement with the condition that the gold variable's modulus of 4 is equal to 0. 
(The modulus operator in JavaScript returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second operand.)

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let gold = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GOLD_BLOCK,function () 
{
    gold += 1
    if (gold % 4 == 0) {
        
    }
})


```

## Step 5

Now we want to add to the If statement the code we want to run if the conditional is true.  We want to have the words "Hello World!" printed in the sky. 
The code for printing with blocks is below. 

blocks.print("text", BLOCK, pos(0,0,0), DIRECTION)

Add the code above with the text of "Hello", the Block of gold, the position of world(-163, 77, 59), and the direction of South inside the if statement. 
After that code, add another blocks print code with the text of "World", the Block of gold, the position of world(-163, 71, 59), and the direction of South.
Then close the if statement and the on blocks placed code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let gold = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GOLD_BLOCK,function () 
{
    gold +=1
    if (gold % 4 == 0) {
        blocks.print("Hello",GOLD_BLOCK,world(-163,77,59),SOUTH)
        blocks.print("World",GOLD_BLOCK,world(-163,71,59),SOUTH)
    }
})

```



## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 7 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

2.  Place down 4 Gold Blocks (you can find them in the chest).
3.  Go to the window to see the words printed in the sky.
4. You know your code works correctly when you see "Hello World!" printed in the sky outside the window.

## Step 8

When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
