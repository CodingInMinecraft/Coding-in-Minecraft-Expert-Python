# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 Activity 7
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

We are going to continue with our code.  (We have placed the clear chat command code on the workspace for you.  We have shortened it for you so it is not so long.)

```template
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
})
```

## Step 2

Now that we have cleared the area, we want to create the outside of the aquarium.  We want our aquarium to be in the middle of the 5x5 area we cleared, but we only want it to be 3x3.  

We will need to move the agent into the correct spot to start building.  He will need to turn right, move forward by 1, and then turn right again, and then forward by 1 again. 

Create a new chat command called move and add this code in that chat command. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("move",  function  ()  {
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
})
```

## Step 3

Next, we want to build the base of the aquarium.    Create a new chat command named base.  
Then, add an if / else statement that has the agent check his inventory in slot 1.

In Minecraft, you can code the agent to test for certain items in their inventory.  The code for this is below. 

    agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GLASS

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("base",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GLASS)  {

	}  else  {

	}
})
```

## Step 4

Continue building the if / else statement.  If it does have glass in it's inventory, the agent will then build the base of the aquarium.  Have the agent first destroy down, then place down and move forward by 1.  It will need to do these steps 3 times, except on the last run, do not have him move forward again. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("base",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GLASS)  {
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
	}  else  {

	}
})
```

## Step 5

The steps you created will build one row of 3.  You need to have the agent build the other 2 rows as well. 
First, have the agent turn left, move forward by 1, and then turn left again.  Then repeat the code you created for row 1.  
For row 3, have the agent turn right, move forward by 1, and then turn right again.  Then repeat the row 1 code again.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("base",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GLASS)  {
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
	}  else  {

	}
})
```

## Step 6

Now we need to add the else section of the if statement.  If the agent does not have glass blocks in it's inventory, set 64 glass blocks in slot 1.  

The code for that looks like this:

`agent.setItem(GLASS,  64,  1)`

After the agent has the inventory, it will need run the same base code as in the if section. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("base",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GLASS)  {
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
	}  else  {
		agent.setItem(GLASS,  64,  1)
				agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
	}
})
```

## Step 9

If your code works as expected, click next to go on to step 10.  If not, go back and fix your code. 

## Step 10

Now let's build the outside of the aquarium around the base.  First Create a new on chat command called outside.  In the chat command, give the agent 64 glass blocks in slot 1. Then move the agent forward by 1. Then add the code to have the agent place on move.  Then have the agent build around the base by the following steps: 

 - Turn Right
 - Move Forward by 3
 - Turn Right
 - Move Forward by 4
 - Turn Right
 - Move Forward by 4
 - Turn Right
 - Move Forward by 4
 - Move up by 1


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

player.onChat("outside",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(GLASS,  64,  1)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
})
```

## Step 11

2. Reset the area. 
3. Open the chat and type clear. 
4. After the area is clear, type move to move the agent into the correct position. 
5. Once the agent is in the correct spot, type base. 
6. Once the base is built, type outside. 
7.  You will know your code is correct when the agent clears the area, moves into position, and builds a 3x3 base for the aquarium, and builds 1 level of the outside of the aquarium.  

## Step 13

If your code works as expected, click next to go on to step 14.  If not, go back and fix your code. 


## Step 14

Now it is time to build the aquarium taller.  You can reuse the code from the first level, starting with the right turn.  However, the first forward should change from 3 - 4.  We want to do 3 levels.  After you have copied the code for level 2, add a move forward by 1, then copy the level 2 code and paste for the rest of level 3.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

player.onChat("outside",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(GLASS,  64,  1)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
})
