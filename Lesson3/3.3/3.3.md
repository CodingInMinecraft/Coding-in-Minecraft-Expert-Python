# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 Activity 6
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

We are going to continue practicing with logic in our code by building an aquarium.  
The first step to building the aquarium is clearing the land. 

Start by creating an on chat command called clear. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	
})

```

## Step 2

Next, inside the chat command, create an if / else statement.  
In the if section, have the agent inspect forward to see if there is a grass block in front of it. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {

	}  else  {

	}
})

```


## Step 3

Next add the code that if the agent does inspect a grass block, it will destroy forward and move forward by 1.  If it does not inspect a grass block, it will just move forward by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
})

```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 5 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

2. Open the chat and type clear. 
3.  You will know your code is correct when the agent destroys the grass block in front of it and moves forward by 1. 

## Step 6

If your code works as expected, click next to go on to step 7.  If not, go back and fix your code. 

## Step 7

We have only cleared 1 block.  If we want to check the entire area, we need to either run the code multiple times or add to the code. 
In Lesson 4 we will learn how to use loops to repeat actions but for now, we will just reuse code we have created. (We will be building a very large piece of code!)

We need to clear a 5 x 5 area which means we need to run this if / else statement 5 times to clear one row, if there were 5 blocks in that row. However, because the first row only has 4 blocks of grass, we only need to run it 4 times this row.  Copy and paste the code **inside the chat command** to repeat it 4 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}

})


```

## Step 8

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 9 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

2. Use your agent device to reset the area. 
3. Open the chat and type clear. 
4.  You will know your code is correct when the agent destroys the entire row in front of it and moves forward 5 times. 

## Step 10

If your code worked as expected, click next to go to step 11.  If not, go back and fix your code.  

## Step 11

Now we will need to have our agent turn left, inspect the block in front, destroy if it is there and move forward by 1.  Then he needs to turn left again to go back down the second row.  
Do this by adding the code to have your agent turn left.  Then add the if /else statement again from before (you can copy and paste. Then, after the if else statement, add the code to have the agent turn left again. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
})
	
```

## Step 12

To go back down the row, the agent needs to move forward by 4 again.  You will need to copy and paste the if / else statement 4 more times after the agent turn left code.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
})
```

## Step 13

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 14 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

2. Use your agent device to reset the area. 
3. Open the chat and type clear. 
4.  You will know your code is correct when the agent destroys the entire row in front of it and moves forward 5 times, then turns and destroys the 2nd row. 

## Step 15

If your code worked as expected, click next to go to step 16.  If not, go back and fix your code. 

## Step 16

Now we will need to have the agent turn right, inspect the block in front, destroy if it is there and move forward by 1.  Then he needs to turn right again to go back down the third row.  
You can do this easily by copying your code from the end of row one and change both Left directions to Right. Then you can copy everything else below it as well to have the agent go back down row 3.

```javascript
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {

	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {

	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}

	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {

	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
})

```

## Step 17

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 18 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Use your agent device to reset the area. 
3. Open the chat and type clear. 
4.  You will know your code is correct when the agent destroys the 3 rows of grass blocks. 

## Step 19

If your code worked as expected, click next to go to step 20.  If not, go back and fix your code. 

## Step 20

Now, you will be able to copy and paste some of your code to do the last 2 rows.  Can you figure out what code that is? 

*Hint... the agent will need to turn left and right 1 more time each.
