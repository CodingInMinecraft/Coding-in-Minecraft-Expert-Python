# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 Activity 4
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

We used If Statements to check to see if a condition is true or false and execute code if the condition is true.  If we want to **execute a code if that same condition is false**, you can extend the If Statement to include Else.  This is referred to as an **If Else Statement.** 

Below is an example of an if else statement that checks to see if the variable for playerAge is greater than or equal to 13.  If the condition is true, the player will say "You can play." If the condition is false, the player will say, "Sorry. You aren't old enough to play."

    let playerAge =  10
    if  (playerAge >=  13)  {
	    player.say("You can play!")
	}  else  {
		player.say("Sorry. You aren't old enough to play.")
	}

## Step 2

Let's build an if statement that checks to see if a player has won the game by checking to see if the score is greater than or equal to 20.  
Start by declaring the variable score and assign it the value of 15.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let score =  15

```

## Step 3

Next, create the if else statement.  Let the If statement use the logic condition of greater than or equal to compare the variable score to the value of 20.  
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let score =  15
if  (score >=  20)  {
	 
	    }
```

## Step 4

Next, have the player say "You win!" if the condition is true. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let score =  15
if  (score >=  20)  {
	 player.say("You win!")
	    }
```

## Step 5

Add the else portion of the statement that will have the player say "Keep playing." if the condition is false. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let score =  15
if  (score >=  20)  {
	player.say("You win!")
}  else  {
	player.say("Keep playing.")
}

```

## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 7 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

## Step 8
When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
