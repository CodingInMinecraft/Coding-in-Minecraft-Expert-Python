# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 3 Activity 5

### @explicitHints true
## Step 1

Let's continue our practice with If Else Statements by adding to our code that had the agent check for grass blocks.  We have put that code on the screen for you. (We have added a loop. You will learn about loops in lesson 4.)
Run the code to remind yourself of what happens when it runs. 

```template
for index in range(3):
    agent.set_item(CORNFLOWER, 64, 1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, DOWN) == GRASS:
        agent.place(DOWN)
    else:
        pass
```

## Step 2

Let's add the ELSE to the IF statement.  Make the agent turn left if the condition is false.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
for index in range(3):
    agent.set_item(CORNFLOWER, 64, 1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, DOWN) == GRASS:
        agent.place(DOWN)
    else:
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        
```

## Step 3

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 4 @unplugged

To test your code:

2.  You will know your code is correct when the agent moves forward, places flowers down on the grass blocks and turns left if there isn't a grass block.

## Step 5

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
