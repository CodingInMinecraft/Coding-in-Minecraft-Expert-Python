## Step 1 @unplugged

As code becomes more complex, programmers will need to break it down into smaller and more manageable pieces. So, programmers create **procedures,** also known as **functions or methods**, to generalize processes that can be reused. 

Here are some reasons we use functions. 

1.  **Reusability:** Functions allow you to define a block of code that can be **executed multiple times throughout your program**. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can encapsulate it within a function and call that function whenever you need to perform a specific task.
    
2.  **Modularity:** Functions promote modular programming by **breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.** By dividing your code into functions, you can focus on solving individual problems and then combine these functions to create more significant functionality.
    
3.  **Abstraction:** Functions provide a way to abstract away the implementation details of a particular operation. This means that **you can use a function without knowing or understanding how it works internally**. By encapsulating complex logic within a function, you can simplify the code and make it easier to work with.
    
4.  **Code Organization:** Functions help in organizing and structuring your code. By grouping related pieces of code into functions, **you can improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.** Functions allow you to separate different concerns and make your codebase more modular and easier to understand.
 

## Step 2 

To define a function in Javascript, **you start with the word function followed by a name and then parentheses.**  Then the code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: **{}**

Ex: function name () {}

When you name functions, follow the same rule as variables.  
Function names can only contain:

 - letters
 - digits
 - underscores
 - dollar signs

Let's practice using functions by first defining a function named buildWall in the space below. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
function buildWall ()  {

}

```


## Step 3

Next, inside the function, let's have the agent build a 4x4 wall by first having the agent place on move and use the set assist code to give the agent 64 stone blocks in slot 1.  Then, add a loop that runs 2 times. Inside the loop, have the agent move forward by 3, up by 1, back by 3, and up by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

function buildWall ()  {
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		agent.move(BACK,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	}
}

```

## Step 4

Now we have defined the function by creating the reusable block of code.  To run that code, we need to **call** or **invoke** the function.  When you invoke a function, you're telling the computer to execute the instructions inside that function. When we make a function call, **it temporarily pauses the regular order of executing statements in a program**. Instead, it jumps to the statements within the function and runs them first. After the last statement in the procedure, or if there is a return statement, the program goes back to the exact point where the function was called and continues executing from there.

To call a function in JavaScript, you simply **write the function name followed by parentheses.** 

Let's create an on chat command named wall and call the function buildWall in the chat command. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
function buildWall ()  {
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		agent.move(BACK,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	}
}
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	buildWall()
})

```

## Step 5

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

2. Open the chat by pressing T. 
3. Type wall and hit enter. 
4. You know your code is correct when your agent builds a 4 x 4 wall.

## Step 7

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
