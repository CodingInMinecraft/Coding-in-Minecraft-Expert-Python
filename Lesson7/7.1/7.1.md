## Step 1 @unplugged

As code becomes more complex, programmers will need to break it down into smaller and more manageable pieces. So, programmers create **procedures,** also known as **functions or methods**, to generalize processes that can be reused. 

Here are some reasons we use functions. 

1.  **Reusability:** Functions allow you to define a block of code that can be **executed multiple times throughout your program**. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can encapsulate it within a function and call that function whenever you need to perform a specific task.
    
2.  **Modularity:** Functions promote modular programming by **breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.** By dividing your code into functions, you can focus on solving individual problems and then combine these functions to create more significant functionality.
    
3.  **Abstraction:** Functions provide a way to abstract away the implementation details of a particular operation. This means that **you can use a function without knowing or understanding how it works internally**. By encapsulating complex logic within a function, you can simplify the code and make it easier to work with.
    
4.  **Code Organization:** Functions help in organizing and structuring your code. By grouping related pieces of code into functions, **you can improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.** Functions allow you to separate different concerns and make your codebase more modular and easier to understand.
 

## Step 2 

To define a function in Python, **you start with the word def followed by the function name.**  Then the code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside parentheses: **()**. End with a colon.

Ex: def buildWall():

When you name functions, follow the same rule as variables.  
Function names can only contain:

 - letters
 - digits
 - underscores
 - dollar signs

Let's practice using functions by first defining a function named buildWall in the space below. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def buildWall():
    pass

```


## Step 3

Next, inside the function, let's have the agent build a 4x4 wall by first having the agent place on move and use the set assist code to give the agent 64 stone blocks in slot 1.  Then, add a loop that runs 2 times. Inside the loop, have the agent move forward by 3, up by 1, back by 3, and up by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def buildWall():
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    for index in range(2):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.move(BACK, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)

```

## Step 4

Now we have defined the function by creating the reusable block of code.  To run that code, we need to **call** or **invoke** the function.  When you invoke a function, you're telling the computer to execute the instructions inside that function. When we make a function call, **it temporarily pauses the regular order of executing statements in a program**. Instead, it jumps to the statements within the function and runs them first. After the last statement in the procedure, or if there is a return statement, the program goes back to the exact point where the function was called and continues executing from there.

To call a function in Python, you simply **write def followed by the name of the function** 

Let's create an on chat command named wall and call the function buildWall in the chat command. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
def buildWall():
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    for index in range(2):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.move(BACK, 3)
        agent.move(UP, 1)

def on_on_chat():
    buildWall()
player.on_chat("wall", on_on_chat)


```

## Step 5

2. Open the chat by pressing T. 
3. Type wall and hit enter. 
4. You know your code is correct when your agent builds a 4 x 4 wall.

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
