The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.
Computing innovations, which include software, hardware, and various technologies, are created with the intention of addressing real-world problems or fulfilling particular interests. For instance, applications like communication tools, social media platforms, productivity software, and video games are all examples of computing innovations designed to solve problems or cater to interests. Creative expression also plays a role, as developers often have the freedom to explore and create new technologies that can inspire, entertain, and inform.
