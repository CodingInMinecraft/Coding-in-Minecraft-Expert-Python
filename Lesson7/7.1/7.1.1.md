## Step 1 @unplugged


Functions in programming can be customized to work with different sets of data. We can do this by using something called "**parameters" or "arguments"**.

**Parameters are like input variables that we can give to a function.** They allow us to pass data into the function, and the function can use that data to do its job. It's like giving instructions to the function on what data to work with.

**Arguments are the actual values we provide for the parameters when we call or use the function.** We use arguments to specify the specific data that we want the function to process.

In addition to accepting inputs, functions can also give us outputs or results. We can get these results by using something called a "return value". When a function finishes running, it can send back a value to us. This can be something like a calculated value or any other result that we need.

So, by using parameters and arguments, we can make functions work with different data, and by using return values, we can get useful results from the function's execution. It's like giving instructions and receiving answers from a function.

## Step 2 @unplugged

In Python, the parameter name or names go in the parentheses after the function name like in the example below. 

    function name (parameter)  {
    
    }

In Microsoft MakeCode, we can use something called **"type annotations"** when adding parameters to functions in Python. 

Type annotations help the MakeCode editor understand the type of data that should be used for a parameter. They provide important information to the editor, which can then give us better suggestions while writing code and help us catch mistakes related to data types.

Therefore, in Microsoft MakeCode after the parameter name you need to add a colon and then the data type as in the example below. 

    function name (parameter: dataType)  {
    
    }

The parameters can be the following data types. 

 - Number
 - String
 - Boolean
 - Array
 - Object
 - Function
 - Undefined
 - Null
 - Symbol



## Step 3 

Let's practice declaring functions with parameters to see how they work. Once again we are going to define a function with the name buildwall. Do so in the space below. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
function buildWall ()  {

}

```


## Step 4

We are going to add the parameter of length. This will allow us to set the length to any number we want when we call the function. The data type of length should be number. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
function buildWall (length: number)  {

}

```


## Step 5

Next, inside the function, let's have the agent build a wall where the parameter will have decided the length. First have the agent place on move and give him 64 gold blocks in slot 1.  Then, add a loop that runs length times. Inside the loop, have the agent move forward by length, up by 1, , turn left 2 times, back by length, up by 1 and then turn left 2 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
function buildWall(length: number) {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setItem(GOLD_BLOCK, 64, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.move( FORWARD, length)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
        agent.move(FORWARD, length)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
    }
}


```

## Step 6

When you call a function that has a parameter, you need to add the **argument** you want the parameter to be in parentheses. 
These arguments are the **values that the function will work with to perform its task.**

For example:
	
	
    functionName(value)

Now, create an on chat command named wall that calls the function with the argument value of 2. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
function buildWall(length: number) {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setItem(GOLD_BLOCK, 64, 1)
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.move( FORWARD, length)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
        agent.move(FORWARD, length)
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
        agent.turn(LEFT)
    }
}
player.onChat("wall", function () {
    buildWall(2)
})


```

## Step 7

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

1. Open the chat by pressing T. 
2. Type wall and hit enter. 
3. You know your code is correct when your agent builds a 3 x 4 wall. (It is a 3x4 because of the place on move.  It moves forward 2, which is the argument, but will place down when it moves up as well.)

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
