## Step 1

Some functions produce an output or a result. When a function has finished executing its instructions, **it can return a value back to the code that called it.**

The code to return a value is return followed by what value you want to return. 

Let's build a code that returns a full name of the player. 

Begin by declaring 2 variables.  One named firstName and the other lastName.  Assign them the value of your first and last name. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let firstName =  "Jennifer"
let lastName =  "Brown"

```

## Step 2

Next, define a function with the name getFullName2 and the function returns the variable firstName plus the variable last name with a space between the 2 variables. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let firstName =  "Jennifer"
let lastName =  "Brown"

function getFullName2 ()  {
	return  ""  + firstName +  " "  + lastName
}

```

## Step 3

Lastly,  create an on chat command called name that calls the function getFullName and has the player say the getFullName return. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let firstName =  "Jennifer"
let lastName =  "Brown"

function getFullName2 ()  {
	return  ""  + firstName +  " "  + lastName
}

player.onChat("name",  function  ()  {
	getFullName2()
	player.say(getFullName2())
})

```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.
