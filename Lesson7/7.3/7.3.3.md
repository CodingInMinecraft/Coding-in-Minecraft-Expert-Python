# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 8 Activity 9
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

One of the built in libraries in MakeCode is the Math library. 
We are going to do an activity using this library.  First declare a variable named gold and assign it the value of 0. 

    
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
gold =  0
```

## Step 2

Next, create an on blocks placed code for a gold block.  In that code have the variable gold increase by 0.3 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
gold = 0

def on_block_placed_gold():
    global gold
    gold += 0.3
blocks.on_block_placed(GOLD_BLOCK, on_block_placed_gold)

```

## Step 3

Now we will use the math library inside an if / else statement.  We are going to use the round function from the math library.  The code is Math.round.  
Create an if /else statement that checks if the Math.round for the variable gold is equal to 3. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
gold = 0

def on_block_placed_gold():
    global gold
    gold += 0.3
    if Math.round(gold) == 3:
        pass
    else:
        pass
blocks.on_block_placed(GOLD_BLOCK, on_block_placed_gold)

```

## Step 4

In the If section of the code, have the player say "You win!" and in the else section have the player say "Keep Going!"

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
gold = 0

def on_block_placed_gold():
    global gold
    gold += 0.3
    if Math.round(gold) == 3:
        player.say("You win")
    else:
        player.say("Keep Going!")
blocks.on_block_placed(GOLD_BLOCK, on_block_placed_gold)

```

## Step 5
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Have your player place down gold blocks. (You can find the blocks in a chest near the activity zone.)
3. You will know you code is correct when your player says "Keep Going!" many times and finally says "You win!"

## Step 7

When your code works as expected move on to the assessment.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
