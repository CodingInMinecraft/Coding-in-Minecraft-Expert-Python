In JavaScript, a library is a collection of code that someone else has already written.

Here's how libraries work in JavaScript:

1.  **Ready-to-Use Code**:  Libraries are ready-to-use pieces of code that you can use in your own projects.
    
2.  **Saves Time**: Libraries save you a lot of time. Instead of writing every single line of code for a specific task, you can use a library that already has that code written. 
    
3.  **Specific Functions**: Libraries often focus on doing specific things really well. For example, you might use a library that's excellent at creating animations, or another one that's great at managing dates and time. These libraries give you special tools for different parts of your project.
    
4.  **Sharing with Others**: Programmers share their libraries with others. It's like a big community where people help each other by offering their pre-made code for everyone to use.
    
5.  **Working Together**: Libraries also help different parts of your program work together smoothly. When you're building something complex, like a website, you can use libraries to handle different tasks, like making things look nice or handling user interactions.

Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used.
Documentation for an API/library is necessary in understanding the behaviors provided by the API/library and how to use them.
Let's break down these concepts. 

1.  **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**: APIs are like rules and instructions that help different software components communicate and work together. It specifies what functions (procedures) are available, what kind of information they need, and what they will give back. Developers follow the API to use the library's functions in their programs.
       
2.  **Documentation Importance**: When you're using a library or an API, you need documentation to understand what each function does, what data it expects, and what it returns. It's like your manual to making the most of the library.
Without API documentation, developers would struggle to use a library effectively because they wouldn't know how its functions behave and fit together.  API documentation guides developers on how to call functions correctly, what arguments to provide, and what results to expect. This ensures they're using the library in the right way.

MakeCode itself provides a range of built-in libraries and extensions however  you will not be able to directly use external libraries that are typically used in languages like Python or JavaScript. Instead, you would usually rely on the libraries and extensions provided within the MakeCode environment.
