# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 4 Activity 1

## Step 1 @unplugged

As we continue to create more complex conditional statements in code, we can use **flowcharts** to help us map out the code.  
Flowcharts use certain shaped blocks to represent certain parts of the code. Read through the chart below to learn about these blocks.

## Step 2 @unplugged

Let's look at a flowchart for one of the codes you built in the last lesson. 
Read through the flowchart to determine what is happening in the code and what conditional is being used.

You should have read that the conditional is that if the agent detects a grass block below him, he will place down a cornflower and if he does not, he will turn left. 

## Step 3 @unplugged
Read through the flowchart below and think about what is happening in the code.

This code would include an if/else statement.  Think about what that if / else statement would look like.  Click next to build the answer. 

## Step 4 

Let's build the code from the flowchart (the image is below if you need to see it again.) We will start with the first step.  We are going to need to create the variable for score. Declare it and assign it the value of 0.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
score = 0

```

## Step 5

Next step (refer to the image below for reference) is to create the code for the agent to move forward by 1. 
Write the code in the coding editor.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
score =  0
agent.move(FORWARD,  1)

```

## Step 6
Next, we need the If/Else Statement (see image below for reference). 
Add an If/Else Statement where the conditional is that if the agent inspects the block down and it is equal to gold, then the variable score goes up by 1 else it goes down by 1.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
score = 0
agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, DOWN) == GOLD_BLOCK:
    score += 1
else:
    score += -1
```

## Step 7
Lastly, we need to have the player say the score in both parts of the If/Else Statement. 
![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.1/4.3.3.JPG?raw=true  "Flowchart")

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
score = 0
agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
if agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, DOWN) == GOLD_BLOCK:
    score += 1
    player.say(score)
else:
    score += -1
    player.say(score)
	
```

## Step 8
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  You will know your code is correct when you see the agent move forward and the player say the score.

## Step 10

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
