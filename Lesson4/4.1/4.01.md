## Step 1 @unplugged

Parallel and distributed computing make use of multiple computers working together to solve difficult problems or handle huge amounts of data in a faster way.

**Sequential computing** is the traditional way of processing information using a single processor or core. Think of it like following a recipe step by step. Each instruction is completed before moving on to the next one.

**In sequential computing, a computer executes instructions in a specific order, one after the other.** It starts with the first instruction, then moves to the second, and so on. It's similar to reading a book from the first page to the last page, without skipping or jumping ahead.

A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps.

## Step 2 @unplugged

**Parallel computing** is a method of processing information using multiple processors or computers simultaneously to solve complex problems or handle large amounts of data more quickly.

Think of it like teamwork. Instead of one person doing all the work, **parallel computing allows multiple processors or computers to work together, dividing the task into smaller parts and solving them simultaneously.**

Each processor or computer in parallel computing can handle a portion of the problem independently. They work together on different pieces of the task at the same time, like a team working on different parts of a project simultaneously.

## Step 3 @unplugged

Parallel computing can help speed up the processing time because multiple processors or computers are working in parallel, tackling different parts of the problem simultaneously. It can be especially useful for tasks that involve complex calculations or analyzing large sets of data. 

However, it's important to note that **not all problems can be easily parallelized.** Some tasks may have dependencies or require coordination between different parts, which makes parallel computing more challenging. Additionally, the effectiveness of parallel computing depends on factors such as the number of processors or computers available, the nature of the problem, and the efficiency of the parallel algorithms used.

## Step 4 @unplugged
In parallel computing, the time it takes to complete a task depends on two things: the time it takes for sequential tasks and the time it takes for the longest parallel task.

To measure the effectiveness of a parallel solution, we use something called "speedup." **Speedup tells us how much faster a parallel solution is compared to doing the same task sequentially.**

To calculate speedup, **we divide the time it took to complete the task sequentially by the time it took to complete the task in parallel.** The result gives us an idea of how much time we saved by using parallel computing.

In simpler terms, speedup measures how much faster we can finish a task by working together in parallel instead of doing it all by ourselves one step at a time.

## Step 5 @unplugged

**Distributed computing** is a method of processing information that involves multiple computers or devices working together as a team. It allows for collaboration and sharing of resources to solve complex problems or handle large amounts of data.

Think of it like a group project. In distributed computing, each computer or device is like a team member with its own set of skills and capabilities. They communicate and work together to complete a task.

Instead of having a single powerful computer doing all the work, **distributed computing divides the task into smaller parts and assigns them to different computers or devices.** Each computer or device works on its assigned part independently and shares the results with the other members of the team.

## Step 6 @unplugged

Distributed computing allows for **efficient use of resources** because each computer can contribute its processing power, memory, and storage to the overall task. This approach can **handle large amounts of data** and perform complex calculations faster than a single computer.

Moreover, distributed computing is often used for **tasks that require a high level of reliability and fault-tolerance.** If one computer in the network fails or experiences a problem, the other computers can continue the work and maintain the overall functionality of the system.

Distributed computing helps us solve problems that would be too big or take too long to handle on a single computer. It allows us to work with larger problems and solve them faster than we could with just one computer. By working together, we can solve bigger problems faster than if we tried to do it all on one computer.
