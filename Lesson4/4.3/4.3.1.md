# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 4 Activity 7
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

Let's continue practicing with nested loops by building a  more complex code that nests the conditionals in both the if section and the else if section.  
Start by creating a chat command called build. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	
})
```

## Step 2

In Minecraft, you can code the agent to test for certain items in their inventory.  The code for this is below. 

    agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS


Next, add an if statement that has the agent test if there is a grass block in its slot 1 inventory.



#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS)  {

	}
})
```

## Step 3

In Minecraft, you can also have the agent check to see how many items are in their inventory.  The code is below. 

    agent.getItemCount(1)  >=  9

Let's add to our If that if the player tests that there is grass blocks in slot one, it will then test to see if there are 9 or more of those grass blocks. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(1)  >=  9)  {
        }
    }			
})
```

## Step 4

Now add if the agent does detect at least 10 grass blocks in slot one, it will place on move and move forward 9 steps.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(1)  >=  9)  {
			agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  9)
		}
	}
})
```

## Step 5

Let's expand this If Statement and add an Else If section.  In the Else If section, have the agent check to see if it has stone blocks in it's slot 2.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(1)  >=  9)  {
			agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  9)
		}
	}  else  if  (agent.getItemDetail(2)  ==  STONE)  {

	}
})	
```

## Step 6

In the Else If code, add the code that if the agent does have stone blocks in slot 2, it will check to see if it has 9 or more of those blocks.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(1)  >=  9)  {
			agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  9)
		}
	}  else  if  (agent.getItemDetail(2)  ==  STONE)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(2)  >=  9)  {
            
        }
    }
})
```

## Step 7

In Minecraft, the agent has multiple slots to hold inventory.  The active slot is defaulted to 1 but you can have him change that with code. The code on how to do that is below. 

    agent.setSlot(2)

Let's add to our Else If section that if the agent does have at least 9 stone blocks in slot 2, we want the agent to first change it's active slot to slot 2.  Then we want the agent to place on move and then move forward by 9. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(1)  >=  9)  {
			agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  9)
		}
	}  else  if  (agent.getItemDetail(2)  ==  STONE)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(2)  >=  9)  {
			agent.setSlot(2)
			agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  9)
        }
    }
})
```

## Step 8

Lastly, let's add the else section that will run if both the If and the Else If sections return false. 
In the else section, have the agent give themselves 9 blocks of grass in slot 1 and 9 blocks of stone in slot 2. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```python 
player.onChat("build",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GRASS)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(1)  >=  9)  {
			agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  9)
		}
	}  else  if  (agent.getItemDetail(2)  ==  STONE)  {
		if  (agent.getItemCount(2)  >=  9)  {
			agent.setSlot(2)
			agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  9)
		}
	}  else  {
		agent.setItem(GRASS,  9,  1)
		agent.setItem(STONE,  9,  2)
	}
})
```

## Step 10 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  Open the chat by pressing T. 
3. Type Build and press enter. 
4. You shouldn't see anything happen, but if you right click on the agent, you will see it now has 9 grass blocks in slot 1 and 9 stone blocks in slot 2.

5. Open chat and type build again. 
6. This time you should see the agent move forward by 9 and place down grass blocks.

7. Open chat and type build one more time. 
8. Now you should see the agent move forward by 9 and place down stone blocks.
