## Step 1 @unplugged

**Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements**. This allows you to create more complex logic and execute different blocks of code based on multiple conditions.

View the flowchart below and determine how it nests its conditionals.

Now, click next to begin building this code. 

## Step 2

Let's start building this code, by first declaring the variable steps and assigning it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 

let steps =  0

```

## Step 3

Next, create the on player walked code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 

let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {

})
```

## Step 4

Add the code that increases the variable steps by 1 inside the on player walked code. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 

let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1

})
```

## Step 5

Add the first If/Else statement inside the on player walked code that has the conditional that tests if the variable step is greater than 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 

let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1
	if  (steps >  0)  {

	}
})
```

## Step 6

Inside the If Statement, add another If Statement that has the condition that tests if the variable steps is less than or equal to 10 and if it evaluates to true, the player will say "Keep going."

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 

let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1
	if  (steps >  0)  {
		if  (steps <=  10)  {
			player.say("Keep going!")

		}
	}
})
```

## Step 7

Add the else section where the player will say "You can stop."

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 

let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1
	if  (steps >  0)  {
		if  (steps <=  10)  {
			player.say("Keep going!")
		}  else  {
			player.say("You can stop.")
		}
	}
})
```
## Step 8
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 9 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  Walk your player around in the game and see what happens. 
3. You will know your code is correct when your player says Keep Going until you get to 10 steps and then the player will say "You can stop."

## Step 10

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
