# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4 Activity 4
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

Let's continue working with If / else if/ else statements by building a code that counts the steps the player takes and responds based on the number. 
First declare the variable of steps and assign it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
let steps =  0
```

## Step 2

In Minecraft, we can use an On Player Walked code.  It is below. Replicate it in your code. 

    player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
    })

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
})
```

## Step 3

Add into the On Player Walked code the code to increase the variable walk by 1.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1
})
```

## Step 4

Now, we will create the If/else if/ else statement by first adding the if section with the conditional of if the variable steps are less than or equal to 5 the player will say "Keep Going."
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1
	if  (steps <=  5)  {
		player.say("Keep Going")
})
	
```

## Step 5

Next, add the else if section of the code with the conditional if the variable steps is less than or equal to 10 the player will say "Almost there!"

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1
	if  (steps <=  5)  {
		player.say("Keep Going")
	}  else  if  (steps <=  10)  {
		player.say("Almost there!")
})
	
```

## Step 6

Last, add the else section of the code that will have the player say "Great work!"

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
let steps =  0
player.onTravelled(WALK,  function  ()  {
	steps +=  1
	if  (steps <=  5)  {
		player.say("Keep Going")
	}  else  if  (steps <=  10)  {
		player.say("Almost there!")
	}  else  {
		player.say("Great work!")
	}
})
	
```

## Step 7

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 8 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  Walk your player around in the game and see what happens. 
3. You will know your code is correct when your player says something with each step and it changes when it hits 5 steps and then again when it hits 10 steps.

## Step 9

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
