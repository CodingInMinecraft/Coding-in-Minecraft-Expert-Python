# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4 Activity 5
### @explicitHints true



## Step 1

Let's create code that will increase the score of the game with every gold block broken and the player can check the score by using a chat command.  
Start by declaring the variable score and assigning it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
let score =  0
```

## Step 2

In Minecraft we can use an on blocks broken code.  The code is below. 

    blocks.onBlockBroken(GOLD_BLOCK,  function  ()  {
    })

Add the code that says on the gold block broken, the score will increase by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

let score =  0
blocks.onBlockBroken(GOLD_BLOCK,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1

```

## Step 3

Next, create an On Chat command called scoreCheck outside of the on block broken code.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

let score =  0
blocks.onBlockBroken(GOLD_BLOCK,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {

})
```


## Step 4

Inside the on chat command add an If / Else If/ Else Statement.  In the If section of the code, create a conditional that says if the variable score is equal to 0 the player will say "You don't have any points."

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

let score =  0
blocks.onBlockBroken(GOLD_BLOCK,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
	if  (score ==  0)  {
		player.say("You don't have any points.")
	}
})
```

## Step 5

Add to the else if section of the code the conditional if the score is less than or equal to 10 the player will say "Your score is *the variable score*." (The variable score is calling the actual variable, not using the words the variable score.)


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

let score =  0
blocks.onBlockBroken(GOLD_BLOCK,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
	if  (score ==  0)  {
		player.say("You don't have any points.")
	}  else  if  (score <=  10)  {
		player.say("Your score is "  + score)
	}  else  {
		
	}
})
```

## Step 6

Last, add the else section of the code that will have the player say "You win the game with a score of *the variable score*." (The variable score is calling the actual variable, not using the words the variable score.)


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

let score =  0
blocks.onBlockBroken(GOLD_BLOCK,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
	if  (score ==  0)  {
		player.say("You don't have any points.")
	}  else  if  (score <=  10)  {
		player.say("Your score is "  + score)
	}  else  {
		player.say("You win with a score of "  + score)
	}
})
```

## Step 7

3. Walk your player around in the game and break gold blocks.  

4. After breaking 5, type scoreCheck in the chat again. You should see your player say "Your score is 5."

5. Walk your player around the game and break 6 more gold blocks. You should see your player say "You win with a score of 11."

## Step 9

When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
