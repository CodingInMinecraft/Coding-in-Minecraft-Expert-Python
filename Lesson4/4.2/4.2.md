# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 4 Activity 3
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

In the last activity, you learned that when you use an If / else statement, the If section provides a condition that evaluates to true or false.  If it is true, the code in the corresponding section will be executed. If it is false, the code in the else section will be executed. 

If you need more than 2 options, you can use an **If / else if / else statement.** 
In an If / else if/ else statement, the If section works the same way it does in an if / else statement.  It provides the condition that evaluates to be true or false. If it is true, the code in the corresponding section will run.  
If it is false, it will go to the else if section.  In the else if section, **there is another condition to evaluate to true or false.**  If it evaluates to true, the code in the corresponding section will run. If it is false, the code in the else section will run.  
View the diagram below to see a visual representation of this statement.

## Step 2 @unplugged

Let's practice by expanding one of the codes we did in the last lesson. 
In Lesson 3 we used the code below to have the agent check for grass blocks under him and if there is, he will plant a flower.  If not, he will turn left.  

    agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)
    agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
    if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
	    agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,1)
	}  else  {
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
}

We are going to expand this code in the next step. 



## Step 3

```template
    agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)
    agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
    if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
	    agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,1)
	}  else  {
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
}
```
Using the code, below, first add in an else if section after the if section by adding in the following code. 

    }  else  if  (false)  {

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)
agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,1)
}  else  if  (false)  {

}  else  {
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
}
```

## Step 4

Next, lets add a new conditional in the else if section that tests if the agent detects stone under him if he does not detect grass. 
You will add in the conditional in the else if section, the same way you did in the if section of the code. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)
agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,1)
}  else  if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  STONE)  {
	
}  else  {
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
}
```

## Step 5

Lastly, add that if the else if section evaluates to true, the agent will move forward. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
agent.setItem(CORNFLOWER,  64,  1)
agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  GRASS)  {
	agent.place(DOWN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,1)
}  else  if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  DOWN)  ==  STONE)  {
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
}  else  {
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
}
```

## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 7 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  You will know your code is correct when the agent moves forward, places a flower down on the grass block or moves forward when on a stone block, or turns left when there isn't either a grass block or a stone block. 
3. You can run the code again to try and see if you get a different reaction from the agent, depending on where he is standing.

## Step 8

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
