## Step 1 @unplugged
You can use text in arrays as well.  

Here are a few reasons why you might use a text array:

**Storing Lists of Words or Phrases:**

You can use a text array to store lists of words or phrases. For example, if you're creating a quiz or a word game in Minecraft, you might have an array to store a list of questions or possible answers.

**Managing Player Names and Locations**

If your Minecraft Education project involves multiple players or locations, you can use a text array to store player names, coordinates, or other textual information.

Click next to learn more reasons. 

## Step 2 @unplugged

**Creating Dynamic Text Outputs:**

Arrays can be used to dynamically generate and display text. For instance, you might create a message based on the current state of the game or the player's progress.

**Iterating Over Text Data:**

You can use loops to iterate over elements in a text array, which is helpful for performing actions on each item in the array.



## Step 3

Let's practice using a text array with player names. 
Create an array named colors with the following names in the array: Steve, Alex, Melanie, Jennifer. Be sure to put quotation marks around each color so the code will recognize it as text.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerNames = ["Steve","Alex","Melanie","Jennifer"]
```


## Step 4
Now, let's have the player say the name that is in space 3 of the array. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerNames = ["Steve","Alex","Melanie","Jennifer"]
player.say(playerNames[3])
```

## Step 5
Next, Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 7
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next NPC. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
