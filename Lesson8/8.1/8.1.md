# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 10 Activity 1

## Step 1 @unplugged
In Python, collections are data structures that allow you to store and organize multiple values or elements. Collections may also be called **lists**. Python provides several built-in collection types, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Let's start learning about lists. 


**Lists:** Lists are the most commonly used collection type in Python. They are ordered, indexed collections of values, where each value is associated with a numeric index. Lists can store values of different types, including numbers, strings, booleans, and even other lists. Here's an example of an list:


    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]


## Step 2 

Let's first learn how to create an list in MakeCode Python.  
First begin with the name of the list followed by the assignment operator (=). 
Below, create a list named numbers. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers =
```

## Step 3
After that, use a square bracket to begin the list, separating each item with a comma. Then close the bracket. 
Add the bracket and the numbers 2, 3,7, 9. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2,3,7,9]
```

## Step 4
We can get the length of any list with the code: 
len(list) (list being the name of the list)

Add to the code below to have the player say the length of the list numbers. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(len(numbers))
```

## Step 5

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 4.

3. When your code works as expected move on to the next Step. If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.


## Step 7
You can also add new elements to the end of the list using the append method.  Let's practice this by adding the element 12 to the end of the list. After the player say code, add the append code you see below:

numbers.append(12)

Then have the player say the player length again. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(len(numbers))
numbers.append(12)
player.say(len(numbers))
```

## Step 8

3. When your code works as expected move on to the next Step. If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.


## Step 10

You can also add elements to certain spots in the code.  Let's try it out. 

After the last player say code, we want to insert the number 4 at the place 2 in the list.  Here is the code for that. 

numbers.insertAt(2, 4)

Then have the player say the entire numbers list. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(len(numbers))
numbers.append(12)
player.say(len(numbers))
numbers.insert_at(2, 4)
player.say(numbers)
```

## Step 11
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.
