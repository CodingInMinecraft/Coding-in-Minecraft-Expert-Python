# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 10 Activity 1

## Step 1 @unplugged
In JavaScript, collections are data structures that allow you to store and organize multiple values or elements. Collections may also be called **lists**. JavaScript provides several built-in collection types, such as arrays, sets, and maps. We are going to start by learning about arrays. 


**Arrays:** Arrays are the most commonly used collection (or list) type in JavaScript. They are ordered, indexed collections of values, where each value is associated with a numeric index. Arrays can store values of different types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. You can think of an array as a list.  Here's an example of an array:


```javascript
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

## Step 2 

Let's first learn how to create an array in MakeCode JavaScript.  
First begin with the word let and then the name of the array followed by the assignment operator (=). 
Below, create an array named numbers. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers =
```

## Step 3
After that, use a bracket to begin the array, separating each item with a comma. Then close the bracket. 
Add the bracket and the numbers 2, 3,7, 9. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
```

## Step 4
We can get the length of any array with the code: 
array.length (array being the name of the array)

Add to the code below to have the player say the length of the array numbers. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers.length)
```

## Step 5

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 4.

3. When your code works as expected move on to the next Step. If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.


## Step 7
You can also add new elements to the end of the array using the push method.  Let's practice this by adding the element 12 to the end of the list. After the player say code, add the push code you see below:
numbers.push(12)
Then have the player say the player length again. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers.length)
numbers.push(12)
player.say(numbers.length)
```

3. When your code works as expected move on to the next Step. If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.


## Step 10

You can also add elements to certain spots in the code.  Let's try it out. 

After the last player say code, we want to insert the number 4 at the place 2 in the array.  Here is the code for that. 

numbers.insertAt(2, 4)

Then have the player say the entire numbers array. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers.length)
numbers.push(12)
player.say(numbers.length)
numbers.insertAt(2, 4)
player.say(numbers)
```
