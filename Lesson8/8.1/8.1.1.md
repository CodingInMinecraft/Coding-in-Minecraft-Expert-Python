# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 10 Activity 2

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
We are going to continue our work with lists. When working with lists, you can traverse it.  **Traversing a list in Python means moving through each element in a list, usually one at a time, to perform some operation on each element.**

Traversing a list can be a **complete traversal**, where all elements in the list are accessed, or a **partial traversal,** where only a portion of elements are accessed. 

 You can access individual elements in the list using their index. In Python, **indices start from 0.** So, fruits[0] gives you the first fruit in the list below, which is apple. 

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

## Step 2
Let's practice accessing the elements from our first list, which has been added below for you. 

Start by changing the code in the player say.  We want the player to say the number in the 0 place.  So the code will be:

numbers[0]

```template
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers.length)

```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(numbers[0])
```

## Step 3
Next, Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

2.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 2.

3.  If your code works correctly, move onto the next step. If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.


## Step 5
We can also change the value of an element in the list by assigning a new value to it. Let's update the code we have.  First, change the player.say to say the number in the 1 place.  


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers[1])
```

## Step 6
Now, change the number that is in the 1 place with the number 5 with the following code:

numbers[1] = 5

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers[1] = 5
```

## Step 7
Now, have the player say the number that is in the 1 place. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers[1] = 5
player.say(numbers[1])
```


## Step 8

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

1.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 3. And then the player will say 5. (This is because the number in the 1 spot was originally 3 and then we changed it to 5.)

2.  If your code works correctly, move onto the next step. If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.

## Step 10
You can also remove elements from the list with code.  Let's remove the last element in our list. The code to remove is below. 

numbers.pop()

Then have the player say the number at the place 3 in the list. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers[1] = 5
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers.pop()
player.say(numbers[3])
```
## Step 11

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 12 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.



![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

1.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 3. And then the player will say 5. Then the player will say undefined. (This is because there is no element in the 3 place anymore. )

2.  If your code works correctly, move onto the next step. If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.

## Step 13
You can also remove the first element in the list with the code below. 

numbers.shift()

Add that code and then have the player say the element in the 0 place of the list. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9]
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers[1] = 5
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers.pop()
player.say(numbers[3])
numbers.shift()
player.say(numbers[0])
```

## Step 14
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 15 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
