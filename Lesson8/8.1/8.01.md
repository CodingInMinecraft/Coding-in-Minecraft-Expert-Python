**A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations.** A well-designed program should be able to handle a range of inputs and scenarios without breaking or producing unexpected results. This ability to accommodate diverse inputs and situations is crucial to ensure that the program remains reliable and useful to a wide range of users. It involves thorough testing, error handling, and consideration of various use cases during the development process.

**The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.**
It includes all the actions and responses that the program produces in response to user input or other triggers. The way the program responds to your actions and the outcomes it produces collectively define its behavior.
Moreover, **a program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function.**

Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.

-   **Tactile:** Physical actions like pressing keys on a keyboard, clicking a mouse button, or tapping on a touch screen.
-   **Audio:** Spoken commands, voice recognition, or sound signals.
-   **Visual:** Images, videos, graphics, or visual cues from a camera.
-   **Text:** Typing text, entering commands, or providing textual information.

Program inputs vary based on the nature of the program and the ways users interact with it. 
Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program.

## Step 4 @unplugged

**Input can come from various sources.** Users can provide input by interacting with a program using devices like keyboards, mice, touch screens, and microphones. 
Additionally, input can come from other programs. For example, one program might send data to another program for processing. 
This interaction between programs allows for more complex and interconnected systems.
