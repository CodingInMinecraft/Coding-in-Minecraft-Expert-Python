# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 10 Activity 8

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
We are going to continue working with objects.  Start by declaring an object named house.  Inside the object add the following keys and values:
blockType - Bricks
length - 5
width - 7



#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,

```


## Step 2

Next create a key named oneLevel and the value is a function.  Inside the function create a for loop that will run 2 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
           
        }
        

    }

}

```

## Step 3
Inside the for loop, have the agent set the Item of the house blockType key with the amount of 64 in slot 1. 
Also have the agent set assist destroy obstacles and place on move both to true. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
   
        }
        

    }

}

```

## Step 4
Still inside for loop, have the agent move forward the house.length key. Then have the agent turn left. Next, have the agent move forward the house.width key and then turn left again. Then close the for loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
  

    }

}

```

## Step 5
Outside of the for loop but still inside the function have the agent move up by 1. Then close the function and close the object. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)

    }

}

```


## Step 6
Lastly, outside of the object, call the function oneLevel. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)

    }

}
house.oneLevel ()
```
