## Step 1 @unplugged

Another built in data type in Python is a **tuple.** 
Imagine you have a list of things, like your favorite fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. In Python, we can put these items into something called a "list." But what if you want to group together some things that shouldn't change, like the coordinates (x, y) of points on a map?

That's where tuples come in. A tuple is a lot like a list, but once you create it, you can't change what's inside it. It's like putting things into a box that's sealed shut.

## Step 2 @unplugged

**How is it Different from a List?**
**Changeability**: With a list, you can add or remove items whenever you want. But with a tuple, once you put things in, they stay that way.
Syntax: To make a list, we use square brackets [], like [1, 2, 3]. But for tuples, we use parentheses (), like (1, 2, 3).
**Use Cases**: Lists are like bags that you can keep adding things to or taking things out of. They're handy when you need to keep changing a group of items. Tuples, on the other hand, are like locked boxes. You put things in, close the box, and they stay safe and unchanged. They're great for things that should stay the same, like coordinates or data that shouldn't be messed with.

So, if you need a collection of items that might change, use a list. But if you want to keep things safe and unchanging, use a tuple!


## Step 3
Let's practice using tuples in our code. First, create a tuple called material by typing the name followed by the assignment operator. Then in parentheses type the items for the tuple. 
Have the tuple include Orange Concrete, Blue Concrete, Green Concrete, Red Concrete, and Pink Concrete. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
material = (ORANGE_CONCRETE, BLUE_CONCRETE, GREEN_CONCRETE, RED_CONCRETE, PINK_CONCRETE)
```

## Step 4
Next, create a for loop that runs 4 times.  In the for loop, first have the agent set 64 items in slot 1 and set the item to pick randomly from the tuple. The code to do that is below. 

agent.set_item(material._pick_random(), 64, 1)


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
material = [ORANGE_CONCRETE, BLUE_CONCRETE, GREEN_CONCRETE, RED_CONCRETE, PINK_CONCRETE]
for index in range(4):
    agent.set_item(material._pick_random(), 64, 1)

```

## Step 5
After the set item code, do the following.  
- Have the agent set assist destroy obstacles to true. 
- Have the agent set assist place on move to true. 
- Have the agent move forward by 7. 
- Have the agent turn Left. 
  
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
material = [ORANGE_CONCRETE, BLUE_CONCRETE, GREEN_CONCRETE, RED_CONCRETE, PINK_CONCRETE]
for index in range(4):
    agent.set_item(material._pick_random(), 64, 1)
    agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 7)
    agent.turn(LEFT)

```


## Step 6
Lastly, outside of the for loop have the agent move up by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
material = [ORANGE_CONCRETE, BLUE_CONCRETE, GREEN_CONCRETE, RED_CONCRETE, PINK_CONCRETE]
for index in range(4):
    agent.set_item(material._pick_random(), 64, 1)
    agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 7)
    agent.turn(LEFT)
agent.move(UP, 1)
```

## Step 7
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

1.  You will know your code is correct when the agent places down a 1 level 7x7 square where each side is a randomly chosen concrete block from the tuple. 


## Step 9
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next NPC. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
