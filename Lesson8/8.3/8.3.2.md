# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 10 Activity 8

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
We are going to continue working with objects.  Start by declaring an object named house.  Inside the object add the following keys and values:
blockType - Bricks
length - 5
width - 7



#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,

```


## Step 2

Next create a key named oneLevel and the value is a function.  Inside the function create a for loop that will run 2 times. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
           
        }
        

    }

}

```

## Step 3
Inside the for loop, have the agent set the Item of the house blockType key with the amount of 64 in slot 1. 
Also have the agent set assist destroy obstacles and place on move both to true. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
   
        }
        

    }

}

```

## Step 4
Still inside for loop, have the agent move forward the house.length key. Then have the agent turn left. Next, have the agent move forward the house.width key and then turn left again. Then close the for loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
  

    }

}

```

## Step 5
Outside of the for loop but still inside the function have the agent move up by 1. Then close the function and close the object. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)

    }

}

```


## Step 6
Lastly, outside of the object, call the function oneLevel. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let house = {

    blockType: BRICKS,
    length: 5,
    width: 7,
    oneLevel: function () {
        
        for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
            agent.setItem(house.blockType, 64, 1)
            agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
            agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.length)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
            agent.move(FORWARD, house.width)
            agent.turn(LEFT)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)

    }

}
house.oneLevel ()
```
