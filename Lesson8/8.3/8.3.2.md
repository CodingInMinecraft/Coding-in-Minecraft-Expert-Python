## Step 1 @unplugged

Another built in data type in Python is a **tuple.** 
Imagine you have a list of things, like your favorite fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. In Python, we can put these items into something called a "list." But what if you want to group together some things that shouldn't change, like the coordinates (x, y) of points on a map?

That's where tuples come in. A tuple is a lot like a list, but once you create it, you can't change what's inside it. It's like putting things into a box that's sealed shut.

## Step 2 @unplugged

**How is it Different from a List?**
**Changeability**: With a list, you can add or remove items whenever you want. But with a tuple, once you put things in, they stay that way.
Syntax: To make a list, we use square brackets [], like [1, 2, 3]. But for tuples, we use parentheses (), like (1, 2, 3).
**Use Cases**: Lists are like bags that you can keep adding things to or taking things out of. They're handy when you need to keep changing a group of items. Tuples, on the other hand, are like locked boxes. You put things in, close the box, and they stay safe and unchanged. They're great for things that should stay the same, like coordinates or data that shouldn't be messed with.

So, if you need a collection of items that might change, use a list. But if you want to keep things safe and unchanging, use a tuple!


## Step 3
Let's practice using tuples in our code. First, create a tuple

## Step 9
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next NPC. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
