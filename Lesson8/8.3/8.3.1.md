## Step 1

Just like in lists, you can access items in dictionaries. 

Let's create a new dictionary and practice some of the ways you can access the items. 

Create a dictionary called friendsColors and have the following keys and values:
Be sure to put quotation marks around each key name. 
key - Jennifer / label - yellow
key - Catrina  /  label - purple
key - Melanie / label - green
Remember, end each key with a colon (:) and end each label with a comma.

```python
friendsColors = {
    "Jennifer" : "yellow",
    "Catrina" : "purple",
    "Melanie" : "green",
}
```

## Step 2
Let's practice accessing one of the items in the dictionary. Add to the code a player say code.  Have the player say the following code:
friendsColors["Jennifer"]

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
friendsColors = {
    "Jennifer" : "yellow",
    "Catrina" : "purple",
    "Melanie" : "blue",
}

player.say(friendsColors["Jennifer"])
```

## Step 3
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

2.  You will know your code is correct when the player says yellow. 
3.  When your code works as expected move on to the next Step. If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.

## Step 5
Next, let's practice changing the values of the dictionary. 
Let's change the value of the key Jennifer to blue. Do this by adding the following code after the player say code. 
friendsColors["Jennifer"] = "blue"
Then have the player say the value of the key Jennifer again. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
friendsColors = {
    "Jennifer" : "yellow",
    "Catrina" : "purple",
    "Melanie" : "blue",
}

player.say(friendsColors["Jennifer"])
friendsColors["Jennifer"] = "blue"
player.say(friendsColors["Jennifer"])
```

## Step 6 following the instructions in the next step.

2.  You will know your code is correct when the player says yellow and then blue. 
   
  

## Step 8
If your code works correctly, move onto the next activity. 
If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
