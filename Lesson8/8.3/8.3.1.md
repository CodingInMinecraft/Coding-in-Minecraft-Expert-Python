# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 10 Activity 7

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

**Objects can also have functions inside them, and these functions are called methods.** Let's practice using this by working off the code from the last activity. We have placed the code below for you. 
Start by deleting the player say code.  

```template
let playerOne = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 16,
    grade: 11,
    
}
player.say(playerOne.name)
```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerOne = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 16,
    grade: 11,
    
}

```

## Step 2

Add another key named greet and the value is a function.  You don't need to give the function a name. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerOne = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 16,
    grade: 11,
    greet: function () {
        
    }
}


```

## Step 3

Inside the function, have the player say "Hello, I'm (playerOne's Name)!" Then close the function. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerOne = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 16,
    grade: 11,
    greet: function () {
        player.say("Hello, I'm " + playerOne.name + "!")
    }
}


```

## Step 4

In order to call the function, outside of the object, write the following code. 
playerOne.greet()

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerOne = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 16,
    grade: 11,
    greet: function () {
        player.say("Hello, I'm " + playerOne.name + "!")
    }
}

playerOne.greet()
```

## Step 5

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.
