## Step 1 @unplugged
Another type of collection is an object. In JavaScript, **an object is like a container that lets you organize and store different pieces of information.** Think of it like a real-world object â€“ for example, a car. A car can have various properties like color, model, and year, and it can perform actions like starting or stopping. Similarly, a JavaScript object groups related information together.

## Step 2 @unplugged
An object is made up of **key-value pairs**. Each key is like a label, and each value is the actual information. For example:

let car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2022,
    color: "Blue"
}
Here, brand, model, year, and color are the keys, and "Toyota", "Camry", 2022, and "Blue" are their corresponding values.

## Step 3
Let's practice building an object.  Start by declaring it with the word let and name it playerOne. Then add the assignment operator and the open curly bracket.

```javascript
let playerOne = {

}
```
## Step 4
Next add the following keys and labels. 
key - name  / label - Alice
key - age  /  label - 16
key - grade / label - 11
Remember, end each key with a colon (:) and end each label with a comma. 

Then close the object with the closing curly bracket.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerOne = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 16,
    grade: 11,
    
}

```

## Step 5
Lastly, have the player say the key name from the object.  When accessing the items in the object start with the name of the object, add a period and then the key you want. 
For example:
playerOne.name

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let playerOne = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 16,
    grade: 11,
    
}
player.say(playerOne.name)
```
