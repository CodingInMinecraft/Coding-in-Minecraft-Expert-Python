## Step 1 @unplugged
Another type of collection is a dictionary. In Python, **a dictionary is a built-in data structure used to store collections of key-value pairs** Imagine you have a big box called a dictionary. Inside this box, you can store lots of pairs of things. For example, let's say you want to keep track of your friends and their favorite colors.

In Python, a dictionary works just like this box. Each pair in the dictionary consists of two parts: a key and a value.

**Key**: Think of the key as the name of something. In our case, it could be the name of your friend.
**Value**: The value is what's special or important about that thing. In our case, it's your friend's favorite color.

Dictionaries are handy because they allow you to organize and quickly find information based on a specific key. They're like having a personalized index for your data!

## Step 2 @unplugged
In a dictionary, each key is associated with a value. Keys must be unique within a dictionary, and they are typically immutable types such as strings, numbers, or tuples. Values can be of any data type and can be duplicated.For example:

car = {
    "brand": "Toyota",
    "model": "Camry",
    "year": 2022,
    "color": "Blue"
}
Here, brand, model, year, and color are the keys, and "Toyota", "Camry", 2022, and "Blue" are their corresponding values.

## Step 3
Let's practice building a dictionary.  Start by declaring it with the name playerOne. Then add the assignment operator and the open curly bracket. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
playerOne = {

}
```
## Step 4
Next add the following keys and labels. Be sure to put quotation marks around each key name. 
key - name  / label - Alice
key - age  /  label - 16
key - grade / label - 11
Remember, end each key with a colon (:) and end each label with a comma. 

Then close the dictionary with the closing curly bracket.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
playerOne = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 16,
    "grade": 11,
    
}

```

## Step 5
Lastly, have the player say the key "name" from the dictionary.  When accessing the items in the dictionary start with the name of the dictionary, then the key in square brackets. 
For example:
playerOne["name"]

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
playerOne = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 16,
    "grade": 11,
    
}   

player.say(playerOne["name"])
```

## Step 8
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next activity. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
