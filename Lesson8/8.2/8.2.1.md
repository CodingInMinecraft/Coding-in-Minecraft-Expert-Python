# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 10 Activity 5

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 

In the last activity, we had the agent place down blocks from the list in a random order. What if we wanted the agent to lay the blocks exactly as they appear in the list? 
We have the original list placed for you in the area below. 
Let's add a few more colors of blocks to this list.  Add Blue, pink, and purple concrete to the end of the list. 

```template
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE
]
```
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE,
BLUE_CONCRETE,
PINK_CONCRETE,
PURPLE_CONCRETE
]
```

## Step 2
Next, create a function named buildRainbow and inside the function add a for loop. The for loop is going to to declare a variable of i and check to see if i is less than or equal to the length of the rainbow list minus 1.  Then increase by 1 each iteration. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE,
    ORANGE_CONCRETE,
    YELLOW_CONCRETE,
    LIME_CONCRETE,
    BLUE_CONCRETE,
    PINK_CONCRETE,
    PURPLE_CONCRETE]
def buildRainbow():
    i = 0
    while i <= len(rainbow) - 1:
        i += 1

```

## Step 3
Inside the for loop, have the agent set the item of rainbow[i], with the amount of 64 in slot 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE,
    ORANGE_CONCRETE,
    YELLOW_CONCRETE,
    LIME_CONCRETE,
    BLUE_CONCRETE,
    PINK_CONCRETE,
    PURPLE_CONCRETE]
def buildRainbow():
    i = 0
    while i <= len(rainbow) - 1:
        agent.set_item(rainbow[i], 64, 1)
        i += 1

```

## Step 4
After the set item code have the agent place left. 
Then have the agent move forward by 1 and close the for loop and close the function. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE,
    ORANGE_CONCRETE,
    YELLOW_CONCRETE,
    LIME_CONCRETE,
    BLUE_CONCRETE,
    PINK_CONCRETE,
    PURPLE_CONCRETE]
def buildRainbow():
    i = 0
    while i <= len(rainbow) - 1:
        agent.set_item(rainbow[i], 64, 1)
        agent.place(LEFT)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        i += 1

```

## Step 5
Lastly, call the function buildRainbow. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE,
    ORANGE_CONCRETE,
    YELLOW_CONCRETE,
    LIME_CONCRETE,
    BLUE_CONCRETE,
    PINK_CONCRETE,
    PURPLE_CONCRETE]
def buildRainbow():
    i = 0
    while i <= len(rainbow) - 1:
        agent.set_item(rainbow[i], 64, 1)
        agent.place(LEFT)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        i += 1
buildRainbow()
```

## Step 6
Next, Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 8
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next activity. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
