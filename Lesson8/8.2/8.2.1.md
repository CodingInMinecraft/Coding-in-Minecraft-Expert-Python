# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 10 Activity 5

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 

In the last activity, we had the agent place random blocks from the array, but what if we want to lay them in the order they are in from the array. 
We have the original array placed for you in the area below. 
Let's add a few more colors of blocks to this array.  Add Blue, pink, and purple concrete to the end of the array. 

```template
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE
]
```
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE,
BLUE_CONCRETE,
PINK_CONCRETE,
PURPLE_CONCRETE
]
```

## Step 2
Next, create a function named buildRainbow and inside the function add a for loop. The for loop is going to to declare a variable of i and check to see if i is less than or equal to the length of the rainbow array minus 1.  Then increase by 1 each iteration. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE,
BLUE_CONCRETE,
PINK_CONCRETE,
PURPLE_CONCRETE
]

function buildRainbow() {
    for (let i = 0; i <= rainbow.length - 1; i++) {


    }
}


```

## Step 3
Inside the for loop, have the agent set the item of rainbow[i], with the amount of 64 in slot 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE,
BLUE_CONCRETE,
PINK_CONCRETE,
PURPLE_CONCRETE
]

function buildRainbow() {
    for (let i = 0; i <= rainbow.length - 1; i++) {
        agent.setItem(rainbow[i], 64, 1)

    }
}


```

## Step 4
After the set item code have the agent place left. 
Then have the agent move forward by 1 and close the for loop and close the function. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE,
BLUE_CONCRETE,
PINK_CONCRETE,
PURPLE_CONCRETE
]

function buildRainbow() {
    for (let i = 0; i <= rainbow.length - 1; i++) {
        agent.setItem(rainbow[i], 64, 1)
        agent.place(LEFT)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}


```

## Step 5
Lastly, call the function buildRainbow. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE,
BLUE_CONCRETE,
PINK_CONCRETE,
PURPLE_CONCRETE
]

function buildRainbow() {
    for (let i = 0; i <= rainbow.length - 1; i++) {
        agent.setItem(rainbow[i], 64, 1)
        agent.place(LEFT)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}

buildRainbow()
```

## Step 6
Next, Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 7 @unplugged

2.  You will know your code is correct when the agent places down all the blocks from the array in the order they are in the array.

## Step 8
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next activity. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
