# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 10 Activity 4

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
Let's practice with more ways to use a list.  We are going to first create a list called rainbow with blocks of various colors.
Create the list with the following blocks: Red Concrete, Orange Concrete, Yellow Concrete, and Lime Concrete.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE, ORANGE_CONCRETE, YELLOW_CONCRETE, LIME_CONCRETE]

```

## Step 2
Next create a for loop that will run 4 times. 
Inside the for loop have the agent place on move set to true. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE,
    ORANGE_CONCRETE,
    YELLOW_CONCRETE,
    LIME_CONCRETE]
for index in range(4):
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
```

## Step 3
After the place on move code, add a agent set item code, but instead of a specific name block, add this code:
rainbow._pick_random().  
Then set the amount to 64 and the slot to 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE,
    ORANGE_CONCRETE,
    YELLOW_CONCRETE,
    LIME_CONCRETE]
for index in range(4):
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.set_item(rainbow._pick_random(), 64, 1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
```
## Step 4
Lastly, have the agent move forward by 1 and close the for loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE,
    ORANGE_CONCRETE,
    YELLOW_CONCRETE,
    LIME_CONCRETE]
for index in range(4):
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.set_item(rainbow._pick_random(), 64, 1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
```

## Step 5
Next, Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 7
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next activity. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
