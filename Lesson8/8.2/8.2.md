# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 10 Activity 4

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
Let's practice with more ways to use an array.  We are going to first create an array called rainbow with blocks of various colors.
Create the array with the following blocks: Red Concrete, Orange Concrete, Yellow Concrete, and Lime Concrete.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let rainbow = [RED_CONCRETE, ORANGE_CONCRETE, YELLOW_CONCRETE, LIME_CONCRETE]

```

## Step 2
Next create a for loop that will run 4 times. 
Inside the for loop have the agent place on move set to true. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE
]
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    
}
```

## Step 3
After the place on move code, add a agent set item code, but instead of a specific name block, add this code:
rainbow._pickRandom().  
Then set the amount to 64 and the slot to 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE
]
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setItem(rainbow._pickRandom(), 64, 1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
}
```
## Step 4
Lastly, have the agent move forward by 1 and close the for loop. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let rainbow = [
RED_CONCRETE,
ORANGE_CONCRETE,
YELLOW_CONCRETE,
LIME_CONCRETE
]
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setItem(rainbow._pickRandom(), 64, 1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
}
```

## Step 5
Next, Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 7
 If your code works correctly, move onto the next activity. 
 If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
