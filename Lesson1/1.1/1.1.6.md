## Step 1 @unplugged

Formatting strings in Python means **creating a new string that includes variables, constants or expressions in a specific format.** This is often used to display information to the user in a more readable way, or to construct complex strings by combining different pieces of information.

## Step 2 @unplugged
In Python, we can format strings using brackets. We do this by inserting placeholders ** for variables, constants or expressions using the '{ }' syntax.** Then, we will need to define the format for the order of the variable placeholders.
Look at the code below and predict what the player will say then run the code to check to see if your prediction was correct. 


   name = "John"
   age = 16 
   message = `My name is {} and I am ${} years old.`.format(name, age)  
    player.say(message)


## Step 3

You should have predicted that the player would say 'My name is John and I am 16 years old.'
Now you write code enclosed in brackets that uses the {} syntax and it formats a string that combines the variables of playerName and playerScore and has the player say the string you created. 
First, declare a variable called playerName and assign it the value of Jennifer. Then declare a variable with the name playerScore with the value of 10. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint
```python
   let playerName = "Jennifer"
   let playerScore = 10
 
   
```

## Step 4
Next, declare a variable named message and give it the value of the sentence My name is playerName and my score is playerScore where the variable names are in the {} and the format is defined.

  #### ~ tutorialhint
```python
playerName = "Jennifer"
playerScore = 10
message = "My name is {} and my score is {}.".format(playerName, playerScore)
  
   
```

## Step 5
Lastly, have the player say the message. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint
```python
playerName = "Jennifer"
playerScore = 10
message = "My name is {} and my score is {}.".format(playerName, playerScore)
player.say(message)
   
```

## Step 6 @unplugged
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the sentence 'My name is Jennifer and my score is 10.'

## Step 7

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
