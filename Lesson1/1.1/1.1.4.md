## Step 1 @unplugged
In Python, a string is a **sequence of characters enclosed in quotes** (either single or double quotes). Strings are a common type of data used in programming, especially for text-based applications.
  
 To create a string variable in Python, you simply **assign a string value to a variable name.**
 For example:

    playerName = "Steve"
    player.say(playerName)

## Step 2

Let's practice creating string variables.  
Declare a variable for playerName with your name as the string. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
playerName = "Jennifer"

```

## Step 3

Next, Have the player say the playerName.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```python
playerName = "Jennifer"
player.say(playerName)

```

## Step 4 @unplugged
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

## Step 5

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
