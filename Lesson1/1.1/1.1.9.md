# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 1 Activity 9
### @explicitHints true


## Step 1 @unplugged

There are times when we might not know the value we want to set a variable to until the game is being played or change the value of a variable during the game. For example, you might want to change your score or your name during the game.

When responding to a chat command event we can add **arguments** to pass variable values in when running the command.

When we talk about arguments in JavaScript, we're talking about **values that we pass into a function.** A function is like a set of instructions that we can reuse over and over again. **We pass in arguments to a function to give it different inputs,** and then the function can do something with those inputs and give us an output.

## Step 2

To practice this, we are going to use an on chat command to run the code.  We will add a chat command which allows us to jump a number of blocks on the Y axis - the number of blocks to be jumped can be provided during the game.

To code a chat command, type the following code. 

    player.onChat("",  function  ()  {
    })
In the space below, type an on chat command with the word jump inside the quotation marks. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("jump",  function  ()  {

})

```

## Step 3

To add an argument the on chat command, type the variable name in the parentheses next to the word function.  We are going to use a variable called Y.  Type Y in the parentheses following the word function. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("jump",  function  (Y)  {

})

```

## Step 4

Next, we want to add to the code what we want to happen when the code runs.  We want the player to jump to the Y position that the argument will set.  First, add the player teleport code into the chat command (between the curly brackets).  Then change the Y coordinate to the variable Y. 

The player teleport code is 

    player.teleport(pos(0,  0,  0))
    
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
player.onChat("jump",  function  (Y)  {

player.teleport(pos(0,  Y,  0))

})
```

## Step 5

In this activity, we chose a variable that we have not yet declared. 
If we would have chosen an existing variable the value of that variable would have been set to the value provided in the chat command.  However, because we chose a new variable, we will need to add the value in the chat command when we run the code.  Follow the instructions on the next step to test the code. 

## Step 6 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Make sure that your player is in the activity zone.  
1.  Open the chat by pressing the letter T on your keyboard. 
2. Type jump 10.  
3. Your player should jump 10 blocks into the air and return to the ground. 
4. You can try other arguments by trying different numbers after the word jump in the chat. (Don't go more than 29 or you will leave the jump zone.)
5. Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 7

Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected mark yourself complete and move on to the Next NPC.

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
