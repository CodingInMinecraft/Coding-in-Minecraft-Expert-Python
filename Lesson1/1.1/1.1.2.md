## Step 1 @unplugged

You can perform various operations with number variables such as arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and more. **Arithmetic operations include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (/) (remainder).**

## Step 2 
Let's build a code using the addition operator. 
First, declare a variable named gamePoint and assign it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let gamePoint = 0

```

## Step 3
Now create a variable called extraPoint and assign it the value of 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let gamePoint = 0
    let extraPoint = 1

```

## Step 4
Next create a variable called finalScore that adds the gamePoint variable and extraPoint variable. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let gamePoint = 0
    let extraPoint = 1
    let finalScore = gamePoint + extraPoint
  
```

## Step 5
Finally have the player say the finalScore. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let gamePoint = 0
    let extraPoint = 1
    let finalScore = gamePoint + extraPoint
    player.say(finalScore)
```

## Step 6 @unplugged
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

## Step 7
If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
