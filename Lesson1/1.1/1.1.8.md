# Expert Coding using Python - Lesson 1 Activity 8
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

In this activity, you are going to practice creating variables for your code.  First, create 3 variables.  The first will be for playerAge and have a number value of 10. The second will be for score and the value equals 0. The third will be playerName and set to the string Alex. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python

playerAge = 10
score = 0
playerName = "Alex"

```

## Step 2

Next, add to the code by creating a variable called extraPoint and assign it the value of 1.  Then use the athematic operator to create a variable called finalScore that adds the score and the extraPoint. And have the player say the finalScore. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
playerAge = 10
score = 0
playerName = "Alex"
extraPoint = 1
finalScore = score + extraPoint
player.say(finalScore)

```

## Step 3

Add to your previous code and create a variable message that uses template literals to say this sentence when it is run "Our player Alex is 10 and has the final score of 1." Then have the player say the message. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
playerAge = 10
score = 0
playerName = "Alex"
extraPoint = 1
finalScore = score + extraPoint
player.say(finalScore)
message = "Our player + %s + is + %s + and has the final score of + %s."%(playerName, playerAge, finalScore)
player.say(message)

```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 6

Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.
When your code works as expected mark yourself complete and move to the next NPC.  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
