# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 1 Activity 11
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

  

In this activity, you are going to practice converting variables explicitly. Using the template below, convert the number 18 to a string by filling in the empty spaces.
```template
let str = ()
player.say(str)



```
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

  

let str= (18)
player.say(str)

  

```

  

## Step 2 @unplugged
Next, continue on to test your code, then come back to complete another conversion

  

  

## Step 3 @unplugged

  

To test your code:

  

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

  

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when  your player says "18", which show the number has been converted to a string.

## Step 4

  

Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again, then come back to the tutorial by pressing "C" on your keyboard.

## Step 5
Now we will see how JavaScript automatically converts many variables using implicit type conversions. Remember, these conversions happen automatically when the variables being converted fit the right types for implicit conversion. Let's practice the concatenation of a string and a number, which are two different variables. 

## Step 6
Delete any code that is in the coding editor. Then, create a variable called "result", followed by an "=" sign. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

  
let result =


```

## Step 7

After the equal sign, add together a string named 'Hello' and the number 18. Next, add a new line with a player.say command, to let the player.say (result).
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

  

let result = "Hello " + 18
player.say(result)


```

## Step 8 @unplugged

  

To test your code:

  

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

  

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when your player says "Hello 18", which show the number is automatically converted to a string using implicit type conversions.

## Step 9

Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected mark yourself complete and move on to the Next NPC.

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
